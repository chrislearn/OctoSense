## Abyssal Currents — OctoSense desktop

`octosense-abyssal-currents.png` is an original image generated for OctoSense
on 2026-09-11 with the built-in image generation tool. It replaces the glass-demo
vector scene. Dark sculpted oceanic folds, restrained teal light and copper
edges leave quiet space for windows and icons.

`octosense-abyssal-currents-light.png` is its light appearance companion, generated
on the same date by editing the dark original with the built-in image tool.
It preserves the curled crest, flowing contours and framing, with pearl ridges,
pale aqua recesses and soft champagne highlights.

- SHA-256: `ac8b9eddf58abb44c001b581530adb16eeb00166a5e71560cc12d9191f6af8f3`.
- Full generation prompt: [abyssal-currents-prompt.txt](abyssal-currents-prompt.txt).
- Embedded in the executable and rendered by Makepad's existing Image widget
  with centered crop-to-fill sizing; no runtime image download is needed.
- Android's animated background is unchanged. This wallpaper belongs to the
  OctoSense desktop style; Omarchy keeps its selected theme image.

The removed `octosense.svg` came from the Makepad WM fork, `OctoSense-org/makepad`, at
`ff134865d5e4491d9f5a2d21278f317826fff888`. Its original source path and hash
remain recorded under `retained_fork_assets.replaced_files` in
`upstream/makepad.json`; it is no longer bundled.

## Tokyo Night — Omarchy

`tokyo-night.webp` is the unmodified `0-winding-road.webp` from Omarchy’s Tokyo Night theme. It is embedded in the executable as the offline fallback when that theme has no installed images. The other Omarchy wallpapers remain optional downloads.
