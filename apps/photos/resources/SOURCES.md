# Sample photo provenance

The six individual portraits are exact copies of the user-provided/generated files in `scripts/individuals/`. `family.png` is copied from `scripts/generated.png`. The originals are preserved.

The landscape JPEGs were downloaded from Unsplash on September 16, 2026. Download parameters: `auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&q=82&fm=jpg`. See the [Unsplash license](https://unsplash.com/license). Photos are bundled for offline sample browsing.

Names, dates, places, titles, and groupings the Photos app shows are demonstration metadata, not inferred identities or original capture metadata. People collections use explicit catalog tags; the app does not perform face recognition.

## Everyday scenes generated September 18, 2026

The 24 PNGs below were generated with the built-in `image_gen` tool using the
six original individual portraits as identity references. Each image was generated
separately, with all people in group images explicitly referenced. The original
portraits are unchanged. These are synthetic sample photographs; their names,
dates, locations and events are demonstration metadata.

The exact prompt, ordered reference files and catalog metadata for every image
are recorded in [generated-scenes.json](generated-scenes.json), together with
final file hashes and the three framing-refinement prompts. Files are copied
without modification from the generated originals into `photos/`.
