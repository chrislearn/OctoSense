# octosense-llm-service: the `llm` host service

The AI providers app (`os.ai-providers`, [../bundle](../bundle)) edits the
LLM providers the AppCard assistant runs on, through this service. The app
never sees a key, a PIN or a QR: keys are typed on a host-owned sheet, the
phone QR is drawn on a sheet, and a scanned code is decoded here. The method
table is in [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs).

Models come from octos's model catalog (`model_catalog.json`, vendored in
[../config/data](../config/data) and read by `octosense_llm_config::catalog`):
`llm.families` and `llm.models` feed the pickers, each model with a display
name, context window and price. Adding or editing a model is a five-step
wizard on the host's sheet, in Octoscode's `/model` order: model family,
model (a pull-down of the family's catalog models, a custom id, or the
endpoint's own list), provider route (the catalog's endpoints or a custom
base URL and protocol), API key, then Test connection and save. The save is
enabled once the test passes; after a network failure the sheet offers
"Save without testing". A catalog route other than the official one is saved
as octos names it (`route_id`, `label`, `base_url`, `api_key_env`); the
official route is saved as no route (octos reads a missing `route_id` as
`official`). The app's own list changes a saved model with a pull-down of the
same catalog and tests each row.

## Registering it (shells)

The providers it edits are the octos kernel's, and the kernel is a shell
service: [`octosense-kernel`](../../../crates/kernel) runs one per
process and hands connections to AppCard and the other consumers. Build the
service with its `octos-core` feature (the shells' `octos-core` feature turns
it on) and it follows the kernel: the profile goes under the kernel's core
dir (`octosense_kernel::core_dir()`) unless the shell names another, and
every change calls `octosense_kernel::restart()` (a no-op when no kernel
runs) before the shell's own hook. Without the feature the service writes
under `octosense_llm_config::profile::default_core_dir()` and restarts
nothing.

Register it once, before the first system app opens, next to Mail, after
configuring the kernel:

```rust
// The kernel first (octosense-kernel): on a phone its core dir is
// <data dir>/octos-home/.octos, on a desktop $OCTOS_APP_CORE_DIR, else
// $HOME/octos-home/.octos.
octosense_kernel::configure(octosense_kernel::Options::default().app_data_dir(data_dir));

// Defaults: the kernel's core dir, the platform's vault, no scanner.
octosense_llm_service::register();

// What a shell normally passes:
octosense_llm_service::register_with(
    octosense_llm_service::Options::default()
        .core_dir(octosense_kernel::core_dir().unwrap()) // the same dir, said out loud
        .scanner(Arc::new(MyScanner::default()))  // phone only
        .image_picker(Arc::new(MyPicker::default())) // a QR from a picture
        .image_drops(true),                       // desktop: drops go to offer_image
);
```

- `core_dir`: the kernel's octos home (`<core_dir>/profiles/_main.json`).
- `vault`: overrides where keys go (tests, `OCTOSENSE_LLM_VAULT=file`).
- `scanner`: an `Arc<dyn QrScanner>`. Leave it out on the desktop; the import
  sheet then takes a pasted `OCTOS1E:` code only.
- `image_picker`: an `Arc<dyn QrImagePicker>`: a file dialog on the desktop,
  the photo picker on a phone. The import sheet then offers "Choose image" and
  reads the provider QR out of the picture (a screenshot, a photo of the
  screen). `llm.providers` reports `image_picker: true`.
- `image_drops`: the shell passes image files dropped on the AI providers app
  to `octosense_llm_service::offer_image(bytes)`; the import sheet then says
  a screenshot can be dropped on it.
- `on_changed`: called after the saved provider set changed (save, reorder,
  removal, import), after the kernel restart. Optional: the restart needs no
  help from the shell. It may run on a worker thread.

The bundle's manifest asks for `llm`; the shell packs `apps/ai-providers/bundle`
like any system app (`system-apps.json`). App Hub's admission knows only the
capabilities in `octosense_app_policy::KNOWN_CAPABILITIES` and refuses any
other, so `llm` has to be added there (beside `mail`, OctoSense-App-Hub
`crates/app-policy/src/manifest.rs`) before the app opens in a shell. The
service serves `os.` apps only.

### A scanner over Makepad

The service does not link Makepad. On Android a shell implements
`QrScanner` over Makepad's `cx.show_qr_scanner()` (OctoSense-org/makepad
`feat/qr-scanner-api`), which answers with exactly one `NativeQrScanned { json }`
or `NativeQrCancelled { reason }` action:

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct ShellScanner { pending: Mutex<Option<octosense_llm_service::ScanDone>> }

impl octosense_llm_service::QrScanner for ShellScanner {
    fn scan(&self, done: octosense_llm_service::ScanDone) {
        if let Some(earlier) = self.pending.lock().unwrap().replace(done) {
            earlier(Err("replaced".into()));
        }
        SignalToUI::set_ui_signal(); // the shell calls cx.show_qr_scanner() on its next event
    }
}

// In the shell's event handling, on the UI thread:
if scanner.wants_open() { cx.show_qr_scanner(); }
for action in actions {
    if let Some(s) = action.downcast_ref::<NativeQrScanned>() { scanner.finish(Ok(s.json.clone())) }
    if let Some(c) = action.downcast_ref::<NativeQrCancelled>() { scanner.finish(Err(c.reason.clone())) }
}
```

### An image picker

```rust
pub enum PickError { Cancelled, Failed(String) }
pub type ImageDone = Box<dyn FnOnce(Result<Vec<u8>, PickError>) + Send>;

pub trait QrImagePicker: Send + Sync {
    /// Let the person choose one image and call `done` exactly once.
    fn pick(&self, done: ImageDone);
}
```

`pick` is called on the UI thread when the person taps "Choose image" on the
import sheet; `done` may be called from any thread, exactly once. Hand over
the file's encoded bytes as stored (PNG or JPEG; do not decode them): the
service decodes, finds the QR (it tries the image as is, thresholded, scaled
down and scaled up, so a phone screenshot with a small code in it works),
refuses anything over 20 MB or 40 megapixels, and then asks for the PIN on
the same sheet, exactly as after a camera scan. `Err(PickError::Cancelled)`
leaves the sheet as it was; `Err(PickError::Failed(why))` shows `why`.

A shell whose picker is modal and synchronous can call `done` inside `pick`;
one driven by Makepad events keeps `done` until its result action arrives, as
the scanner above does. On the desktop that is Makepad's native open panel:

```rust
// pick(): keep `done`, then on the UI thread:
cx.open_select_file_dialog(FileDialog::new().set_id(id).add_filter("Images".into(), vec!["png".into(), "jpg".into(), "jpeg".into()]));
// FileDialogAction::FileSelected { id, paths } -> done(Ok(std::fs::read(&paths[0])?))  (on a worker)
// FileDialogAction::FileCancelled { id }        -> done(Err(PickError::Cancelled))
```

### Dropped images

Sheets (Splash isolates) receive no file drops, so a shell that can take one
answers it itself: while `octosense_llm_service::wants_image()` is true (an
import sheet is up and waiting), a drag of an image file over the AI
providers app gets `DragResponse::Copy`, and the drop's bytes go to
`octosense_llm_service::offer_image(bytes)`, which reads the code on a worker
and hands it to the sheet (it then asks for the PIN). Register with
`.image_drops(true)` so the sheet waits for one.

### Reading the image

`image_qr::find_code(bytes)` (PNG or JPEG) tries the picture as it is and
Otsu-thresholded, scaled down (long side 1600, 1000, 700) and scaled up
smoothly (1.5 to 3 times when small), and takes the first code rqrr reads
that is an OctoSense provider code. Measured: QR-A (69 modules with its quiet
zone) reads from about 2 pixels a module in a 1080×2280 screenshot (about
140 px wide) and from 90 px as a crop; JPEG at quality 40 reads; a 12 MP
photo reads through a scaled copy. Errors are "No QR code found in that
image.", "…not an OctoSense provider code.", "That image is too large (at
most 20 MB and 40 megapixels)." (checked from the header, before decoding)
and "That file is not a PNG or JPEG image.".

## The phone QR and the import

The export sheet shows the `OCTOS1E:` code and its PIN for five minutes,
counting down, and closes itself at 0 (the service closes it too, 5 s later,
should the sheet stop counting); the code and the PIN are held by that sheet
only and are gone with it. `OCTOSENSE_LLM_QR_SECONDS` (or
`Options::qr_lifetime_secs`) shortens the five minutes for end-to-end tests;
it cannot lengthen them.

Sheets are swapped in the same Splash isolate, and a swap does not stop the
timers the old program armed, so no sheet arms a repeating timer (the waiting
sheet polls with one-shot timers, then asks for the swap with
`llm.sheet.show` and no callback), and none defines `fn tick()`, which
Splash itself calls once a second.

An import only adds; nothing is ever removed or reordered by it, and there
is no confirm step:

- Nothing saved: the code's providers are saved as they are (its first is
  the primary).
- Providers saved: they keep their order (the primary stays the primary).
  For each provider in the code, in its order:
  - the same route as a saved one (family, model, base URL, protocol; its key
    in one of the family's slots) keeps its place and takes the code's key
    ("updated");
  - any other is appended as a fallback ("added"). When its key env var is
    one a saved provider reads and the code's key differs from the saved one
    (or the saved one cannot be read), it gets a key slot of its own,
    `<FAMILY>_<n>_API_KEY` (n = 2, 3, …, the first no provider, profile
    value or vault entry uses), written to the profile as its route's
    `api_key_env`; octos reads each route's key from its own `api_key_env`.
    With the same key it shares the slot.
- The old single-provider JSON follows the same rules.

Importing the same code again changes nothing. The sheet and the app say what
happened: "Saved X as primary.", "Added X, Y as fallbacks.", "Updated the key
for Z.", or "Already saved: …". Removing a provider drops its slot from the
profile when no other provider reads it.

## Where keys go

octos reads a key from `config.env_vars.<ENV>` in the profile; a `keychain:`
value there means "read it from octos's secret store" (octos-cli
`auth/keychain.rs`). So ([src/vault.rs](src/vault.rs)):

| platform | key goes to | profile value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | login keychain, service `octos`, account `<ENV>`, via the `security` tool | `keychain:` |
| Linux | `<core_dir>/secrets/<ENV>` (0600; the kernel's octos home is the core dir) | `keychain:` |
| Android, iOS, others | the profile itself (app-private, 0600) | the key |
| `OCTOSENSE_LLM_VAULT=file` | the profile itself (development: no keychain) | the key |

octos has no secret store on Android and reads raw `env_vars` there, so a key
sealed with an Android Keystore key (as Mail's passwords are) would be
unreadable to the kernel. A key the keychain refuses also stays in the profile.

## Tests

From `apps/ai-providers`:

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

The workspace resolves Makepad, Octoscript-Makepad and Octoscript from
checkouts beside this repository (`../makepad` and so on, as the shells do),
and the makepad one must carry the contained-app runtime the shells build with
(splash host requests and sheets). To use another checkout without editing
the manifest, pass a `--config` file with `[patch."https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad.git"]`
entries pointing at it. The macOS keychain test runs only when asked:
`cargo test -p octosense-llm-service -- --ignored keychain`.

## The `model` service (`model.complete`)

The same crate offers a second family, `model` ([src/complete](src/complete)):
contained apps granted the `model` capability make a direct, one-shot,
schema-checked call to the person's providers (OctoSense ADR 0002, "Direct
one-shot model calls"). The app names a model class (`fast` or `strong`), a
task, an input and a JSON Schema; the host picks the provider in the
person's order, sends no output-token cap, validates the reply (retrying
once), refuses URLs unless the app allows them, caps the reply at 16 KiB and
charges a per-app daily budget (defaults: 6 calls a minute, 100 calls and
100,000 tokens a UTC day) kept in `<host dir>/model/ledger.json`. The app
never sees the provider, the model id or the key. The method table and the
error codes are in [src/complete/mod.rs](src/complete/mod.rs).

`crates/ai-host` registers it with the `llm` service:

```rust
octosense_llm_service::register_model(&options, octosense_llm_service::complete::Options::default());
```

Tests use a fake transport: `cargo test --locked -p octosense-llm-service --test complete`.
A live check against DeepSeek (costs a fraction of a cent):
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=… cargo run --locked -p octosense-llm-service --example model_complete_live`.
