# Android performance and launcher records

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Engineering records for the phone shell on the OnePlus 6 bench (15–16 September 2026). Raw runs, traces, APKs and helper scripts they cite live in the bench machine's `target/perf-artifacts/` (ignored by git); the records carry the hashes and per-run tables.

- [perf-gap-analysis.md](perf-gap-analysis.md) — where the frames go: per-scenario diagnosis, ranked costs, the kgsl GPU/clock measurements, why the Vulkan build is slower, and the two candidate rounds that landed (scene cache, flat materials, sheet capture, deferred app capture, fade overlay).
- [performance-plan.md](performance-plan.md) — the target, the measurement contract, dated status paragraphs.
- [launcher-plan.md](launcher-plan.md) — the Home-role decision, what public APIs do and do not give, the Phase 4 (privileged) probe, the home-page pulls.
- [system-integration-plan.md](system-integration-plan.md) — notification, SMS, networking and power integration through a companion APK and root service; actual phone capabilities, permission boundaries, and implementation order.
- [api-call-telemetry.md](api-call-telemetry.md) — live Binder streams, Perfetto call timing, targeted Java/native API inspection, decoding limits and a proposed capture workflow.
- [ADR 0001: Hybrid Android launcher and system bridge](../../../docs/adr/home/0001-hybrid-android-launcher-and-system-bridge.md) — accepted architecture for native-launcher parity, package/interface contracts, privilege boundaries, recovery, rollout and acceptance criteria.
- [adr-0001-implementation-record.md](adr-0001-implementation-record.md) — Home/bridge phone evidence, real notification fixture tests, the native Quickstep experiment and rollback, tool versions and remaining parity milestones.
- [systemui-shade-replacement.md](systemui-shade-replacement.md) — the global OctoSense notification/controls panel, phone validation, exact deployed artifacts and recovery.
- [octosense-systemui-build.md](octosense-systemui-build.md) — the native SystemUI fork, device-page preview evidence, build process and release-signing deployment boundary.
- [perf-findings-oneplus-6t.md](perf-findings-oneplus-6t.md) — the earlier OnePlus 6T / Android 11 findings; keep its numbers apart from the OnePlus 6 ones.
- [validation-record.md](validation-record.md) — the bench's validation log: exact patches and APK hashes, run blocks, rejections.
- [vulkan-probe-record.md](vulkan-probe-record.md) — the unchanged Vulkan backend on the same phone, with its kgsl trace.
- [../build-tool.md](../build-tool.md) — why the fork's `cargo-makepad` is part of the framework: how its activity differs from upstream's, what a stock tool breaks, keeping `cargo makepad` on the fork's tool.
