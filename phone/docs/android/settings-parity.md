# OctoSense Settings replacement checklist

Updated: 2026-09-25. Target: the complete system Settings experience on the
OctoSense OnePlus 6 ROM (LineageOS 22.2 / Android 15), implemented using the shared
Octoscript–Makepad presentation and trusted typed service boundary in
[ADR 0006](../../../docs/adr/home/0006-builtin-settings.md).

## Audit baseline and status rules

The actual ROM build checkout was inspected read-only at
`packages/apps/Settings`, clean commit
`0f0669fc699f70adb20fe6ed4b2ff1c600da6f86`. The inventory comes from
`res/xml/top_level_settings.xml`, `system_dashboard_fragment.xml`, the associated
feature XML files/controllers, and `packages/apps/LineageParts/res/xml`.
Controller visibility, overlays and hardware can hide individual features;
inventory presence is not proof that a particular phone supports them.

**Implemented** means an OctoSense screen reads real state and performs the
listed supported operations. **Native link** means the current screen delegates
that area to Android Settings; it does not count as replacement UI. **Missing**
means no dedicated OctoSense implementation or verified direct route. A broad
Android Settings recovery entry does not turn every missing row into a native
link. The second implementation increment has emulator validation; hardware and
full parity gates remain open.

## Navigation target

Use a searchable Settings overview with these stable sections. Keep related
advanced controls inside their section and show supported controls based on
capabilities, rather than duplicating Android's current top-level arrangement.

| Section | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Connections | Internet/Wi-Fi, SIM/mobile, hotspot/tethering, VPN, private DNS, data usage |
| Connected devices | Bluetooth, NFC/payments, USB, casting, printing and accessories |
| Appearance | OctoSense themes, wallpaper, system colors and light/dark schedules |
| Display | Brightness, timeout, font/display size, rotation, lock screen and LiveDisplay |
| Sound and vibration | Stream volumes, ringtone/sounds, haptics and charging sounds |
| Notifications and Modes | Notification policy/history/channels, lock screen notifications, DND rules |
| Apps | Installed apps, defaults, permissions, special access and storage/data policy |
| Battery | Status, usage, saver, charging controls and app battery policy |
| Storage | Capacity/categories, per-app storage, removable media and cleanup |
| Security and privacy | Lock/biometrics, credentials, permission/privacy controls, Trust and work/private profiles |
| Location and safety | Location/scanning, emergency information and alerts |
| Accounts | Accounts, sync, passwords/passkeys/autofill and provider sign-in |
| Accessibility | Screen reader, text/vision, hearing, input/motor and shortcuts |
| System | Languages/input, gestures/buttons, date/time, users, updates, backup/reset, developer options |
| About phone | Model/build, Android/security patch, kernel, hardware/status, legal and diagnostics |

Octos/provider configuration can become a separate OctoSense section; it is not
a substitute for any Android/Lineage parity row. Preserve existing removal of
the unrelated App Hub store app from Home's app catalog; system app management is a
different Settings feature and remains a target here.

## Feature parity ledger

All rows require real service readback, permission/policy checks, loading/error
states and persistence after process restart. The acceptance column adds checks
specific to each feature. “Native link” is the current migration status, not the
desired final behavior.

## Security and delivery gates

The module/instance root check runs before every command. DeviceSetting is a
finite typed union; both Rust and Android validate values, permissions, policy
and version support. Read snapshots use optional fields, correlated request IDs,
bounded retry and active-page polling. Timeout or queue resynchronization never
replays a mutation. The ROM helper retains package/signature checks and a
[privileged permission allowlist](https://source.android.com/docs/core/permissions/perms-allowlist).
Native modules sharing Home's UID/process are trusted code, not mutually isolated
Android sandboxes.

Credentials, authentication tokens, biometric templates and private keys stay
inside platform/provider-owned flows. OctoSense may launch a specifically
authorized secure flow and consume its limited outcome; it must not simulate
the secure confirmation UI or bypass authentication. See
[Gatekeeper](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/authentication/gatekeeper)
and [platform biometric authentication](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/biometric-auth).

Each completed row needs: Rust capability/state tests, backend validation and
readback tests, emulator behavior where applicable, OnePlus 6 hardware checks,
external-change/restart checks, light/dark/live-theme and narrow-screen checks,
localization, accessibility, ordinary-script denial and restricted-user behavior.
The upstream Makepad Android accessibility path is incomplete. The dedicated
Settings virtual-node adapter now derives visible controls from the compiled
widget tree; unit coverage does not by itself establish Android/TalkBack parity.
Retain recovery navigation while device and assistive-service acceptance remains
open.

Suggested order: (1) core observed device controls and informative pages;
(2) connection management; (3) app/notification/Modes and battery/storage policy;
(4) security/privacy/accounts through secure platform APIs; (5) accessibility,
input, device-specific Lineage controls and advanced system flows; (6) intent,
search, localization and complete hardware parity. Parallel backend work must
not mark rows implemented before their actual OctoSense UI passes acceptance.


The stable editor transport gate passed on isolated Gboard/API35 build2431:
cold first-focus typing, eight immediate Ctrl+A replacements, eight Clear/input
runs, Back remaining hidden through refresh and after native Activity return,
retap and Done. A real InputConnection/native EditText fixture covers composition,
selected/surrogate deletion and retired editor query/action isolation. Later2432 cold tests exposed duplicate pre-focus InputConnections. Build2436 fixes
that session ownership defect: six cold Gboard and six immediate hardware trials,
eight Ctrl+A and eight Clear trials, Back/retap/Done and native-Activity return
passed on Gboard. The independent AOSP emulator passed three cold, four Ctrl+A,
four Clear trials and native-Activity return. Initial inactive replies preserve
pre-focus handles; pause/inactive retirement invalidates every handle in the
cohort. The Android regression fails before the fix and passes afterward. This evidence does not complete the language/input Settings feature
area, TalkBack or all-IME/hardware acceptance. No physical phone was modified.
