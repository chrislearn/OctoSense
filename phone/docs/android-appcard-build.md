# Android build with AppCard's framework, buildtool and bundled kernel

> The octos kernel is a Home service now (`octosense-kernel`, feature
> `octos-core`, always on in Android builds), not AppCard's: **every** APK
> bundles `liboctos.so`, and `rom/scripts/build-home.sh` does it for you (it

OctoSense on the phone now runs the Octoscript-AppCard module (`apps/appcard`)
on the makepad fork's AppCard framework line and needs three things the stock
`cargo makepad` build does not give it:

1. **The framework pin.** `Cargo.toml`, `apps/reference/Cargo.toml` and
   `apps/appcard/Cargo.toml` pin every makepad crate at the fork's
   `port/appcard-on-octoscript` branch (`dd8562e2c87ee835bf7ff282db3e1052eb15bad3`):
   the octoscript line plus the AppCard framework — the `sys.*` / `agent.*`
   engine installed into every Splash isolate, the fetch layer, `gps.rs`, the
   AppCard widget set, fonts and textures. Nothing to do at build time; it is
   the pinned rev.
2. **The buildtool `cargo-makepad`.** The fork's `port/appcard-on-octoscript-buildtool`
   branch (`557effba373ef069ebe3df5ec071ebdfe4c99270`) is that framework plus
   AppCard's Java activity: GPS `LocationListener` → `makepad_platform::gps`,
   notifications, share and deep-link intents, WebView bridge, file picker,
   `downloadFile`, `MAKEPAD_ANDROID_EXTRA_LIBS` and `--min-api`. It also honours
   `resources/android/AndroidManifest.xml.template` (this repo ships one:
   AppCard's permissions and intent filters, label OctoSense, package
   `dev.makepad.octosense`, not persistent).
3. **The octos kernel**, cross-built for `aarch64-linux-android` and bundled
   into the APK as `liboctos.so`. Android lets an app exec only from its
   nativeLibraryDir, so the kernel must ship as a "library"; Home's kernel
   service (`octosense-kernel`) finds it there and runs `octos serve
   --stdio` with `HOME=<files>/octos-home` when the first consumer (AppCard,
   Rinx) connects.

## The shell an Android build is

Android builds are the standalone mobile shell: the Android phone shell fills
the screen inside the safe-area insets, with no desk bar (no style dropdown,
Desktop/Phone toggle, Light/Dark or rotate button) and no desktop style
compiled in — Light/Dark is the **Dark mode** tile in the shade's controls.
`build.rs` turns the `mobile_only` cfg on for `target_os = "android"`, so the
plain `cargo makepad android run` below needs no feature flag. Desktop builds
stay universal (every desktop style and the bar) unless built with
`--features mobile-only`, which is the same standalone shell in a phone-sized
window — the way to check a phone change without the phone.

## Step by step

```sh
# 0. Paths (adjust): a checkout of the fork and of Octoscript-AppCard (with its
#    `octos` submodule initialised), and the Android toolchain dir that
#    `cargo makepad android install-toolchain` produced earlier.
FORK=/path/to/makepad-fork          # https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad.git
APPCARD=/path/to/Octoscript-AppCard # octos submodule at deb433e9 or later
TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/android_33_macos_aarch64   # ndk/, platforms/, build-tools/, platform-tools/, openjdk/

# 1. The buildtool cargo-makepad. It looks for the toolchain relative to its
#    own source tree (tools/cargo_makepad/android_33_<host>), so link it in.
git -C "$FORK" fetch origin 'refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/os/*'
git -C "$FORK" worktree add "$FORK-bt" os/port/appcard-on-octoscript-buildtool
ln -s "$TOOLCHAIN" "$FORK-bt/tools/cargo_makepad/android_33_macos_aarch64"
( cd "$FORK-bt" && cargo build -p cargo-makepad )
CARGO_MAKEPAD="$FORK-bt/target/debug/cargo-makepad"

# 2. The kernel, exactly as AppCard's tools/build-android.sh builds it:
#    NDK clang for API 33, target aarch64-linux-android, features api,git,ast.
NDK=$(ls -d "$TOOLCHAIN"/ndk/* | sort -V | tail -1)
LLVM="$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin"
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER="$LLVM/aarch64-linux-android33-clang"
export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_AR="$LLVM/llvm-ar"
export CC_aarch64_linux_android="$LLVM/aarch64-linux-android33-clang"
export CXX_aarch64_linux_android="$LLVM/aarch64-linux-android33-clang++"
export AR_aarch64_linux_android="$LLVM/llvm-ar"
export RANLIB_aarch64_linux_android="$LLVM/llvm-ranlib"
( cd "$APPCARD/octos" && cargo build --release --target aarch64-linux-android \
    -p octos-cli --bin octos --features api,git,ast )
KERNEL="$APPCARD/octos/target/aarch64-linux-android/release/octos"   # ~130 MB

# 3. Build, install and launch OctoSense with the kernel bundled. From this
#    repository's root, with the phone authorised over adb:
MAKEPAD_ANDROID_EXTRA_LIBS="liboctos.so=$KERNEL" \
  "$CARGO_MAKEPAD" makepad android run -p octosense --release
```

The exact invocation used for the foundation PR, with the paths of that
session, for the record:

```sh
MAKEPAD_ANDROID_EXTRA_LIBS="liboctos.so=<scratch>" \
  <scratch> \
  makepad android run -p octosense --release
```

## Checking the result

```sh
ADB="$TOOLCHAIN/platform-tools/adb"
"$ADB" shell pidof dev.makepad.octosense                       # the app is up
"$ADB" shell pm path dev.makepad.octosense                     # the installed APK...
unzip -l target/makepad-android-apk/octosense/apk/octosense.apk | grep liboctos   # ...carries the kernel
"$ADB" logcat -d -s Makepad | grep -E 'stdio:|kernel'          # the kernel's start
```

At startup Home logs `octos: kernel service ready (starts on first use),
core dir …` (or `octos: no octos kernel: …/liboctos.so is not bundled` for an
APK built without it). When the AppCard tile starts (the module delivers
`Event::Startup` to the hosted app on first contact), the app's agent
connects to the kernel service, which starts the kernel and logs

- `octos-core: starting kernel 1: …/lib/arm64/liboctos.so serve --stdio` —
  the bundled kernel was found and started; the agent's `session/open`
  follows;
- `kernel: no octos kernel: …; using the WebSocket transport` — the APK has
  no kernel; the app shows its login screen.

The kernel is Home's, one per process: the module's `shutdown` drops the
agent's connection when the tile's instance is torn down, and the kernel
stops when its last consumer leaves. When the AI providers change, the `llm`
service restarts it (`octos-core: stopping kernel 1: the octos kernel
restarted`) and the agent reconnects to the new one.

On a desktop Home's kernel service runs a local kernel only when
`OCTOS_APP_CORE_BIN` names the `octos` binary (its data dir:
`OCTOS_APP_CORE_DIR`, else `~/octos-home/.octos`; it runs `serve --stdio
--data-dir <dir>` plus `--config <dir>/config.json` when that file exists,
with `OCTOS_HOME=<dir>`); otherwise AppCard uses the WebSocket transport /
login screen, so a developer's own `octos serve` is never touched.

## Card approvals across builds

octos-app pins every card it admits to the runtime bundle that admitted it
(`l0_approval_store::require` with `SPLASH_RUNTIME_BUNDLE`) and fails closed
on a stale receipt: after a new APK the card draws nothing until the store is
archived for re-admission — the standalone app's own deployment action
(`MAKEPAD_REAPPROVE_CARDS=<digits>` renames the store to
`l0-approvals-before-studio-<digits>`). OctoSense does this itself on
Android: `build.rs` stamps the build with `OCTOSENSE_BUILD_ID` (the epoch
second it was configured, renewed by any source change), and the first
launch of a new build archives
`<files>/.config/octos-app/l0-approvals` under that name and remembers the id
in `octosense-host-build` next to it
(`octosense_appcard::reapprove_cards_for_host_build`). Nothing to do by hand
after `cargo makepad android run`; the manual equivalent, for an APK built
elsewhere, is

```sh
"$ADB" shell "su -c 'mv /data/data/dev.makepad.octosense/files/.config/octos-app/l0-approvals \
  /data/data/dev.makepad.octosense/files/.config/octos-app/l0-approvals-before-studio-$(date +%s)'"
```

## The hosted module in the phone's captures

The phone desk never draws a client directly: each tile is recorded into a
`WindowFrame` (a pass of its own) and the texture is presented in the
client's slot — the app viewport, a split pane, a Recents card, a home tile —
under the shell's overlays (island, groups, keyboard, shade). A hosted module
draws into that pass like a process's frames land in it, with one thing to
know: a pass has an overlay of its own, and `WindowFrame` scopes it
(`Overlay::begin_nested_for_pass`) for the whole recording. Everything the
app draws through `begin_overlay_*` — the AppCard kit's glass surfaces, a
popup, a modal — composites into the capture, last, and never into the WM
window's overlay. Before that scope existed those lists painted over the
shade and the home page and stayed on screen after the tile was gone. The
module's tile forwards a press, a new touch or a wheel step to the app only
when it begins inside the tile's rect; the shell's recognizer has already
declined that finger by the time the tile sees it.

## Provisioning the LLM key

The quoting-safe way is `scripts/provision-appcard-llm.sh <family> <model> <key>`: it builds the JSON, ships it through both shells intact, restarts OctoSense with the extra, and waits for the app to log `provisioned LLM`. GLM keys come in two families: `zhipu` for a bigmodel.cn key (OpenAI-style endpoint) and `zai` for a z.ai key (Anthropic-style endpoint); using the wrong one yields HTTP 401 even with a valid key.


The kernel needs an LLM profile before a request can run. The buildtool
activity forwards launch-intent extras prefixed `makepad.` to the app's
environment, and the app reads `MAKEPAD_PROVISION_CONFIG` on startup and
writes the profile into the kernel's config:

```sh
"$ADB" shell "am start -S -n dev.makepad.octosense/.MakepadApp \
  --es makepad.PROVISION_CONFIG '{\"llm_family\":\"zai\",\"llm_model\":\"glm-5.2\",\"llm_key\":\"<key>\"}'"
"$ADB" logcat -d -s Makepad | grep -iE 'provision|turn/start|turn FAILED'
```

`provisioned LLM from intent: …` in logcat is the proof the profile landed;
the next request goes to the provider (a wrong key fails the turn with the
provider's auth error, not with `profile '_main' is not configured`).

## What the tile shows

The whole app: its sessions and composer over the bundled kernel (the login
screen when there is none). A request typed into the composer — or submitted
through the module's `ask` tool — is routed by the app's brain and its card
rendered by the L0 pipeline in a Splash isolate. With location granted, the
buildtool activity feeds the device's fix to `makepad_platform::gps`, and a
card whose place is blank has the engine reverse-geocode the fix
(photon.komoot.io), so it names the real place. Live values log
`Script data fetch: issuing …` / `loaded …` in logcat.

Two things learned verifying this on a OnePlus 6T:

- A Splash isolate is minted without the framework's `sys`/`agent` engine
  (`widgets::script_mod` installs it into the main VM only, and octos-app's
  `register_script_mods` does not install it), so it is NOT in scope inside
  a card's isolate. The module installs it with
  `register_splash_isolate_mod(register_agent_module)`; without that the
  body fails with "variable sys not found" and the live Splash keeps showing
  its previous (empty) view with no log line. The host test
  `appcard_isolates_carry_the_sys_engine_after_register` guards this.
- The phone is one shared device: a `cargo makepad android run` from another
  checkout reinstalls `dev.makepad.octosense` (PackageManager kills the
  running instance: `stop … due to installPackageLI`) and the first launch
  right after an install-over-a-running-app can come up with a black
  surface. Force-stop, then launch, before judging a capture.
