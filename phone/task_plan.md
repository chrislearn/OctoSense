# OctosMap — 2026-09-18

## Objective
A maps app for the OctoSense phone shell with the interface of Google Maps,
built on the framework's route app ([`apps/route`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad/tree/1d3d383e84a66dbb18a4a860f505430c9d5b20f4/apps/route)): a full-screen
map under a search bar, a place sheet, directions by car, on foot and by
bike, and turn-by-turn navigation. One of the shell's apps, as Photos and
News are.

## Phases
1. Investigate the reference, the shell's app contract and the AppCards ecosystem; settle the open decisions with the person — complete.
2. Design and plan — complete; `docs/plans/2026-09-18-octosmap-design.md`, `docs/plans/2026-09-18-octosmap.md`.
3. The crate, test-first: geometry, the Photon and OSRM parsers, guidance, the sheet, the model — complete (Tasks 1–7).
4. The view: Explore, Search and Place, Directions, Navigation; the module and its storage; the window — complete (Tasks 8–13); every screen checked on the desktop, screenshots in `target/octosmap-verify/`.
5. Host wiring, documentation and backlog — complete (Tasks 14–15).
6. Desktop verification in the phone shell — see `progress.md`.
7. The OnePlus 6T: GPS, gestures, the soft keyboard, a real drive — waits for the phone on adb.

## Current context
- Branch `feat/octosmap`, one commit per task, nothing pushed.
- Decisions: hybrid global data plane (hosted vector archive, Photon, FOSSGIS OSRM); native interface around one persistent `MapView`; v1 without saved places, category chips, a home tile or assistant tools; no framework changes.
- `.gitignore` and `scripts/` hold the person's own uncommitted work and are never staged.

# Photos royalty-free expansion — 2026-09-18

Goal: Add 32 varied royalty-free photos to feat/photos, eight dated in each of June, July, August and September 2026.

1. Select diverse photos and verify source licensing — complete; Pexels source pages and license checked.
2. Download, inspect and integrate assets with metadata and provenance — complete; all 32 visually reviewed, sources and hashes recorded.
3. Validate catalog, dates, embedded assets and Photos regressions — complete; 75 unique catalog entries, 8 additions/month, all 21 tests pass.
4. Rebuild, install and verify on the connected phone — complete; updated APK installed successfully, Library shows 75 photos, June section and September Memory visually verified.

# Photos everyday scenes — 2026-09-18

Goal: Add 24 natural full-body photos based on the six original portraits: three solo scenes per person and six groups of two, three or four people. Work only in feat/photos.

1. Inspect identity references and existing catalog — complete.
2. Generate and visually review 24 separate images using built-in image_gen — complete; three group compositions refined to preserve full bodies.
3. Add images, people/event metadata and provenance to the Photos library — complete.
4. Run catalog and Photos regression checks, inspect final asset set — complete; 21 Photos tests, formatting, whitespace, image decoding and catalog/hash validation passed.

5. Build the Photos branch for the connected OnePlus 6T, install without clearing data, launch Photos and inspect the device screen/logs — complete; installation succeeded and Library visibly shows 43 photos with the new images.

Constraints: preserve original portraits and user albums; keep ages/likeness; retain full bodies including shoes; natural everyday environments; preserve prompts in apps/photos/resources/generated-scenes.json.

# Photos continuation — 2026-09-17

## Objective
Make the Photos Library grid zoomable with pinch on mobile and scrolling on
desktop, following [Makepad's `apps/photos`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad/tree/1d3d383e84a66dbb18a4a860f505430c9d5b20f4/apps/photos) where useful.

## Phases
1. Recover prior scope, inspect the current implementation, and establish the test/device baseline — complete; 12 Photos tests pass.
2. Inspect reference Photos zoom and document the implementation/validation steps — complete; see `docs/plans/2026-09-17-photos-library-zoom.md`.
3. Implement Library zoom and verify its affected behaviors — complete; 21 Photos tests, shell compile check, and formatting pass.
4. Validate on the connected phone and update documentation — the maintainer confirmed the zoom on a device build; `docs/photos.md` records the behavior, the checks, and the stale `PortalList` drag-state caveat. No new device evidence was captured by this session.

## Current context
- Main includes Photos PR #12 at `e55ad6d`; no tracked application code changes at session start.
- Library, Collections, albums, search, People, Memories, and home-card previews were completed previously.
- User selected Library zoom: pinch on mobile and scrollbar on desktop, and supplied the Makepad Photos reference.
- OnePlus 6T `19f8cedf` is connected.
- Removed this session's preliminary import plan and failing test; no import application code was written.

# Previous task — OctoSense Photos (2026-09-16)

## Objective
Build a working Photos app within OctoSense-mobile, guided by Apple's Photos App Store screenshots. Separate the camera Library from Collections (user albums and automatically generated Memories). Prefer OctoSense AppCards, widgets, and Octoscripts; consult [Makepad's `apps/photos`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad/tree/1d3d383e84a66dbb18a4a860f505430c9d5b20f4/apps/photos) as a reference.

## Phases
1. Clarify data source, interactions, and validation platform; inspect reference screenshots and local architecture — complete.
2. Document the design, reuse decisions, and implementation plan — complete.
3. Implement the Photos data model, persistence, native UI, and shell integration — complete.
4. Verify functional flows and visual layout on the chosen platform(s); fix defects — complete on the connected OnePlus 6T.
5. Document run instructions, scope, and validation evidence — complete; see `docs/photos.md`.

## Working constraints
- User requested clarifying questions before implementation and autonomous continuation to a working app.
- Preserve the untracked image-generation script and all generated family photos.
- Keep existing unrelated code, historical planning records, and the reference Makepad checkout intact.
- Confirmed: sample images plus generated portraits, full album/viewer/Memories interactions, and validation on the connected OnePlus 6T.

## Errors
- Initial combined skill/repository output was truncated; subsequent reads are bounded and grouped by topic.

# MakeOS scoping plan (historical)

## Objective
Implement the agreed minimal standalone MakeOS project derived from Makepad's `apps/wm`, runnable with `cargo run`, with process hosting and explicit tracking/sync of copied upstream files. User approved the proposed first milestone.

## Phases
1. Inspect destination, source app, repository state, and instructions — complete.
2. Trace crate dependencies, runtime assets, platform assumptions, and app-hosting mechanisms — complete.
3. Compare extraction and upstream-sync approaches; define implementation scope and acceptance criteria — complete.
4. Document the proposed plan and discuss consequential open decisions with the user — complete; user approved.
5. Import source with provenance and resolve pinned external dependencies — complete.
6. Adapt desktop resources, startup, state, and app catalog; add reference app — complete; review fixes verified.
7. Implement and test upstream maintenance workflow — complete; 24 maintenance fixtures passed.
8. Run relevant tests and verify plain cargo run plus hosted app interaction — complete; root and independent-copy smoke checks passed.
9. Review, document, and finalize runnable project — complete; final inventory and whitespace check passed.
10. Design one-command daily sync using the updated local Makepad HEAD — complete.
11. Add regression tests and implement cached staging, automatic verification, reports, and review-branch handoff — complete.
12. Verify no-op, success, conflict, failed-check, and concurrent-edit behavior; document the daily command — complete; 40 script tests and full native verifier passed.

13. Resolve upstream ae20efc5 conflicts and verify the standalone upgrade — complete; all checks passed and the verified candidate is ready for the review-branch handoff.

14. Merge completed sync into main and adopt the fork WM features — complete; main advanced to 8b2dc9c before import, fork features integrated with 205 Rust and 44 Python tests plus native glass/style and cargo run validation. See `docs/plans/2026-09-08-fork-wm-features.md`.

15. Restore the Omarchy startup wallpaper — complete; bundled the original default image with provenance, retained installed-image precedence and opt-in downloads, and verified offline startup plus all style transitions.

16. Reuse the fork’s installed Qwen model — complete; linked the existing GGUF into MakeOS state and verified hosted local inference. Outer-pane input routing remains a separate unverified observation, documented with the test evidence.

17. Document local AI installation for other users — complete; per-user storage, pinned verified download, existing-model reuse and model ignore rules documented and checked.

## Daily sync requirements (2026-09-06)
- User performs the source Git pull/fetch; the command uses local HEAD by default and never pulls or commits.
- Automate comparison, safe staged merging, coordinated pins/lockfile, compile/tests, release build, and both native smoke modes.
- No new revision means a fast no-op. Real updates require a clean MakeOS tree.
- Reuse an ignored staging build cache; serialize syncs to prevent cache interference.
- Retain comparison, verification logs, smoke artifacts, and failure candidates for review.
- Create a dedicated review branch only after successful checks. User owns review, commit, merge, and push.

## Constraints
- Minimize copied code; prefer external crate dependencies where practical.
- Track exact upstream provenance and deliberate local changes.
- Do not modify the Makepad checkout.
- Implementation and GUI verification are authorized by the user's approval.
- Destination is the MakeOS directory (later OctoSense; now `home/` in this repository); interpret this as the project root unless clarified.

## Agreed defaults
- macOS first; retain platform branches without promising untested targets.
- Process-hosting reference app; keep optional module infrastructure.
- Pinned Git crates, lean default app/services set, separate MakeOS state.

## Proposed plan
`docs/plans/2026-09-04-makeos-extraction.md` contains the implementation sequence, sync strategy, agreed assumptions, and acceptance criteria.

## Errors and limitations
- Initial `rg --files` returned exit 1 because the destination is empty.
- The initial combined source AGENTS.md read was truncated; inspect relevant sections separately as needed.
- Some exploratory queries were overbroad and truncated; subsequent source reads use bounded ranges.
- `config/omarchy` does not exist; source references found so far are comments, not runtime loads.
- A resource search included nonexistent `platform/derive`; useful matches were returned from the real paths, and no dependency on that directory was assumed.
- Git initialization and dependency fetching required sandbox escalation; both completed after approval.
- Imported tests assuming bundled app registry were adapted to explicit fixture/catalog entries. Shutdown test needed a condition-based wait for grandchild exit.
- Code review found final host shutdown cleanup, process-group escalation, and asynchronous startup error reporting gaps; corrected and verified with regression tests and native smoke checks.
- Runtime inspection exposed stale run-view widget geometry after the startup background disappears; explicitly selecting the live surface area fixed it.

## Official work update — 2026-09-11

19. Resolve fork-specific API/style compatibility, integrate all WM changes and crate updates in an isolated candidate — complete.
20. Verify tests, desktop GPU hosting/styles and Android builds; update provenance/docs and apply reviewed candidate without losing local edits — complete (iOS upstream failures and unavailable ADB device documented).

## OctoSense rename
21. Inventory project identifiers, state compatibility, packaging and provenance — complete.
22. Rename active code, Cargo targets, resources, scripts and documentation; retain historical provenance and compatibility — complete.
23. Verify Cargo/tests, desktop branding and hosting, Android package metadata, and sync integrity — complete (no ADB device attached).

## OctoSense wallpaper and light appearance
24. Replace the desktop SVG with the original Abyssal Currents raster wallpaper — complete; all-style native smoke and hosted input verified on feat/desktop-wallpaper.
25. Add a light OctoSense palette and matching wallpaper using the existing appearance controls — complete. Preserved the dark palette, Android animation, and upstream crate pins.
26. Verify both appearances, hosted app reloads and style transitions; document assets and setup — complete. 219 Rust/49 Python tests, release build, all-style native smoke, top-bar toggle and fresh-app checks passed. Ready for the requested feature-branch commit and PR to main.
