# OctosMap Android 9 HTTPS fix — 2026-09-23

- Android Java HttpURLConnection is limited by the system TLS implementation. The FOSSGIS routing server rejects TLS 1.2 today; Android 9 cannot negotiate its TLS 1.3. This reproduces MAPS-17.
- Use the already locked reqwest/rustls stack for Android Maps service requests, with normal certificate validation and HTTPS-only URLs. Keep desktop/iOS and map-tile transport unchanged.
- Responses must retain the 4 MiB cap, service User-Agent, cancellation and stale-reply filtering.
- Confirmed fixed on OnePlus 6T Android 9: all three travel modes return and draw routes; simulated driving preview advances. A separate lost USB internet tunnel caused an initial search timeout and was restored without changing the transport implementation.

# OctosMap findings — 2026-09-18

- The fork's `apps/route` is the reference checkout's in all but three cosmetic files; the map libraries are identical. It builds at the pinned revision.
- The route app's own search and routing API (`makepad.nl/api`) is Europe only: `Santa Clara` finds nothing, San Jose to San Francisco is `no route found`. Its hosted tile archive is planet-wide with street detail.
- Photon (search, reverse) and the FOSSGIS OSRM servers (`routed-car|foot|bike`) answer from the US with real profiles; the OSRM demo server has driving only.
- `makepad-map-nav` has no dependencies, `Route` and `Maneuver` have public fields and `NavSession::new` is public: an OSRM reply becomes a route the framework's session follows.
- `NavSession` names the next maneuver more than 3 m ahead and matches positions within 300 m ahead of progress.
- `MapViewAction::PinTapped` is an overlay layer's pin (EV chargers), not a base-map point of interest. `MapView` has no fit-to-bounds and no satellite imagery; its markers are pins in a colour. `set_center` emits `ViewportChanged`, a pass late.
- The platform has location on every target (`cx.start_location_updates`, `Event::LocationUpdate`/`LocationError`); Android asks for the permission itself on the first start. The shell's module view forwards every event but unfocused keys and outside presses.
- The AppCards repo already has a Google-Maps-like `nav` card (L2 and L0) on the same services; its own review recommends a persistent native map because a card's state change tears the map down.
- A toggle's state must be set after its first draw; naming a DSL template's child again replaces it; a button's colours are uniforms, so two faces beat run-time tinting.
- Apps without a home tile are icons on the phone's home grid (Mail, Sheets, Reference).

# Photos royalty-free expansion — 2026-09-18

- Selected 32 photos spanning animals, architecture, city streets, transport, food, nature, hiking, sports, books and music.
- Pexels source pages identify the photos as free to use; license: https://www.pexels.com/license/. Each source and photographer is recorded in resources/stock-photos.json.
- User requested dates across recent months; eight sample dates per month from June through September, none in the future.
- Existing build.rs embeds all files in photos; existing catalog enables Library, search, Memories and album selection without new UI code.

# Photos everyday scenes findings — 2026-09-18

- Portraits inspected individually. Alex: wavy dark hair, stubble. Sofia: long dark hair. James: short white hair, dark glasses. Rose: short silver curls, thin glasses. Noah: school-age boy with tousled brown hair. Lily: school-age girl with long light brown hair.
- Existing catalog names explicitly identify the six sample characters. Reference portraits in resources/photos are exact original copies.
- Catalog additions automatically enter Library, People, search, Memories and album selection; no saved-album changes or new app behavior are needed.
- build.rs embeds the photo directory. Existing UI/catalog regression incorrectly assumes exactly six solo photos; replace this with coverage of six distinct people.
- Final output: 24 selected PNGs, 64.92 MiB. Three group images needed wider framing; built-in image edits corrected them. Original image outputs remain in the generation directory, and local framing drafts are outside bundled resources under ignored target/photos-scenes-review/drafts.
- Generation plan: 18 solos across work, school, stadium, market, garden, woodland and coast; 6 groups with pair, trio and four-person compositions.

# Photos continuation findings — 2026-09-17

- User selected Library zoom with mobile pinch and desktop scrollbar/scrolling.
- The reference Photos delegates to `libs/image_tiles/src/grid.rs`: wheel zoom
  uses `exp(-delta_y * 0.0025)` around the pointer; dragging pans the wall.
- Current Library is hard-coded to three slots/chunks and rebuild resets scroll
  to zero. Zoom requires variable slots/chunks plus preserving a focal photo.
- A visible desktop zoom slider covers the requested scrollbar interaction;
  wheel zoom follows the supplied reference, and the vertical scrollbar navigates.
- Recovered the completed Photos implementation plan and merged commit history.
- Current image loading uses compile-time bundled bytes and a 19-entry catalog;
  saved JSON stores albums/favorites, without an imported-photo catalog yet.
- Connected device is still the OnePlus 6T (`19f8cedf`).
- Initial inspection output was too broad and truncated; subsequent reads are bounded.
- Baseline `cargo test -p octosense-photos --locked`: 12 tests pass.
- Cargo patches use the pinned checkout `../.sources/makepad`, prepared by
  `python3 scripts/setup-home.py`; framework changes are not part of this task.
  Its native `FileDialog` supports filtered multiple selection.
- Android picker results are `content://` URIs; `want_bytes` currently tries
  `std::fs`, so it cannot load Android selections. Use the existing native picker
  and a Photos-local ContentResolver reader on a worker thread.
- Android reference: https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/documents-files
  describes ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT, URI results, and ContentResolver streams.

# Photos app findings — 2026-09-16

## Visual reference observations
- Inspected all five actual iPhone screenshots from Apple's App Store listing.
- Library: edge-to-edge three-column square grid with 1–2 px gutters, white header over imagery, floating translucent date-density controls and bottom navigation.
- Month view: large rounded lead photo plus a row of three smaller photos, strong month headings, white background.
- Collections / People: white surface, bold section headings, rounded photographic tiles with bottom-aligned white labels; bottom pill combines Library and Collections, with a separate search circle.
- Memories: full-screen photo, central play/pause, prominent bottom title/date, small thumbnail strip. Editing screenshot is out of this milestone's requested scope.
- Working visual thesis: quiet white surfaces and blue actions let family and travel photography dominate, with restrained floating controls.
- Content plan: Collections opens with a featured Memory, user Albums, People, and utility collections; Library is a dated photo grid; details reduce chrome around the image.
- Interaction thesis: tab selection animation, swipe-to-next viewer, timed memory slideshow, and native scroll momentum.

## Confirmed scope and architecture
- User confirmed sample photos plus the existing portraits, with more images to be added later.
- User confirmed Library and Collections, photo viewer, editable albums, and generated Memories.
- User selected connected Android device validation: OnePlus 6T (`19f8cedf`).
- Root Cargo already registers a `photos` module from the upstream picture-wall app, on Android/iOS and via `app-photos` on desktop. A new local `apps/photos` module can replace that provider without changing the launch identity.
- Existing AppCard integration delegates to `octos-app::AppShell`, which is an AI card/composer application with a kernel/transport lifecycle. Reusing its full shell would add unrelated behavior. Primary reusable UI lives in [Makepad's `widgets/src/kit.rs`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad/blob/1d3d383e84a66dbb18a4a860f505430c9d5b20f4/widgets/src/kit.rs), Splash/Octoscript, and shared image widgets.
- `apps/reference` provides a minimal local AppModule and standalone entry-point pattern. Keep the Photos module in this workspace and leave the Makepad reference checkout unchanged.
- Five iPhone screenshot asset URLs were extracted from the actual App Store HTML; queued for direct visual inspection.
- The Octoscript-Makepad desktop photo search example explicitly uses placeholder tiles and lacks real image/keyboard behavior; it is not a complete Photos implementation.

- User wants an Apple Photos-inspired native app with Library and Collections, user-managed albums, and automatic Memories. Primary implementation source is OctoSense's AppCards/widgets/Octoscripts; the sibling Makepad Photos project is a secondary reference.
- Reference: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photos/id1584215428. Page fetched; screenshot assets still need visual inspection.
- Initial working tree has only untracked `scripts/generate_image.py`, `scripts/generated.png`, and `scripts/individuals/`. These assets belong to the user and must be preserved.
- Seven generated family images are available locally for optional sample content.
- Existing planning files describe completed historical MakeOS/OctoSense work. Their instructions and assumptions are historical context, not current user authorization.
- Clarifications requested: bundled versus device photos, interaction scope, and desktop versus Android validation.

### Device implementation findings
- Native script imports are snapshots: newly declared Photos components need `mod.widgets.Photos…` qualification within the same script block. `ImageFit.CropToFill` and `MouseCursor.Hand` require explicit enum qualification; `Words` and `Ellipsis` are prelude values.
- Shared Labels inherit padding. Zero padding plus ink-centered text and explicit alignment prevents fixed-height captions from clipping. Icon-only buttons require zero spacing and a zero label walk for geometric centering.
- PortalList grid dimensions must come from the active layout turtle on the current draw, not a stale root area. Hide empty Image widgets to avoid black cells.
- Kit navigation surface colors must be declared as shader instances so the shared selection controller can update them. The final selected pill and label colors were inspected on the phone.
- The installed Android app did not contain `liboctos.so`; the new APK preserves that existing deployment mode. An existing complete SDK/NDK was reused, without editing the framework checkouts.

# MakeOS findings (historical)

## Initial observations
- The MakeOS project root (later OctoSense; now `home/` in this repository) is empty; no Cargo package, Git metadata, or local instructions were present.
- Source app: [Makepad's `apps/wm`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad/tree/1d3d383e84a66dbb18a4a860f505430c9d5b20f4/apps/wm).
- User requests discussion and planning before implementation.
- Makepad's source runbook documents built-in `--remote` controls for later runtime verification and asks that agent-created test instances be closed afterward.

## Evidence still to collect
- Source commit, working-tree modifications, package manifest, file inventory.
- Transitive Cargo dependency closure and runtime resource paths.
- Actual embedded-app loading model and platform limitations.
- Minimal import inventory and repeatable upstream comparison workflow.

## Source snapshot and initial dependency boundary
- Source HEAD: `83a00d2801e4864c42c3a40e85186a8b1743fd84`, branch `work`, origin `git@github.com:makepad/makepad.git`.
- No tracked source changes reported. Four unrelated example directories are untracked.
- WM is a binary-only package (`makepad-wm`, binary `wm`); its manifest has no library entry point.
- Eight non-optional direct Makepad dependencies: widgets, studio-protocol, network, wm-api, ai-services, strict-json, app-module, wm-theme.
- Three optional application crates are enabled by default: sheets, photos, aichat (all with their own default features disabled).
- WM contains both child-process hosting and statically linked module hosting. Source manifest labels Linux session/compositor mode as future work.
- `shell/ui.rs` has font references reaching outside the package (`self:../../widgets/resources/...`), while icons live under WM resources.
- The Makepad root includes Cargo patches for bitflags, smallvec, windows-link; a separate root must assess whether these need reproducing.
- Installed toolchain: rustc 1.98.1; Cargo 1.98.1.

## Extraction hazards confirmed in source
- `clients.rs:303` detects a Makepad checkout via an environment override or ancestor `Cargo.toml` plus `local/`; it otherwise resolves binaries beside WM. This needs a MakeOS-specific app location policy.
- The process registry is a hard-coded curated list. Supporting user-added applications independently requires a small external manifest/registration seam; module overrides alone do not add apps.
- Process launch uses `cargo run --release -p ...` in a Makepad checkout, passing `--stdin-loop` and `STUDIO_HOST`, `STUDIO_BUILD`, `STUDIO_CRATE`. It has existing child output and process-group cleanup handling worth preserving.
- `main.rs:handle_startup` auto-starts aichat (even with a closed pane), starts warm-pool management, and fetches missing wallpapers. Warm capacity covers two terminals and one each of browser/files/task.
- Theme defaults are embedded Rust strings. Theme/user state currently resides under `MAKEPAD_HOME` or `~/.makepad/wm`; MakeOS should have its own default state directory while preserving compatible child protocol environment names where needed.
- `config/omarchy/shell.json` appears in explanatory comments, but no such source directory exists; it is not yet evidence of a required file to copy.
- Exact remote availability of the source commit is not verified: web opening the GitHub commit returned an internal error.
- Cargo documentation confirms Git dependencies can select crates inside a repository by name and pin `rev`; Cargo still fetches the Git repository. This minimizes files maintained in MakeOS, not necessarily first-download size.

## Reference documentation
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html

## Inventory and reuse conclusions
- Tracked WM footprint: 69 files, 881,317 bytes: 27 Rust files (23,057 lines, including tests), 41 SVG icons, and one manifest. The import can remain under 1 MB before any optional added assets or fixture code.
- Read-only `cargo metadata --offline --locked --no-deps --format-version 1` succeeded. It confirms WM has only a binary target and the dependency/feature inventory above. This is manifest validation, not a build or transitive dependency resolution test.
- `origin/work` locally contains the chosen source commit. The live remote could not be verified through the web tool (commit and raw manifest fetches failed); implementation must verify actual Cargo fetchability.
- `makepad-widgets` currently declares version 2.0.0, but that does not establish that all WM APIs are available in published registry releases. A single shared Git revision is the safer initial dependency choice.
- `makepad-ai-services` has an empty default feature set; retaining its wire/service code does not inherently enable the model engine. Removing it would require editing the WM's existing bus and module interfaces.
- Terminal has a reusable library for PTY/session/terminal/widget functionality, but its complete application remains in `src/main.rs` plus `src/ai.rs`. It cannot be turned into a complete hosted executable with a one-line call to a library app entry point.
- Sheets exports a real `SHEETS_MODULE`; this offers an already implemented lightweight module candidate without copying Sheets code. Its standalone executable still has its own application main.
- Cargo library dependencies do not supply ready-built sibling application executables. A process-hosting milestone needs a bundled executable target, an explicitly managed build/install step, or a development manifest launch.
- Makepad's resource resolver supports named crate references and development-time files in dependency checkout paths. Fix copied WM font references to identify the widgets crate; packaged distribution requires a separate resource staging check.
- WM launcher currently treats a linked module as available even when default hosting is Process. If a module is bundled, availability and actual selected launch mode must agree; otherwise a visible row can still lead to a missing process binary.
- Upstream source and Cargo.lock remained unchanged by inspection.

## Daily sync automation findings
- The existing update verifier runs Cargo metadata/check/tests and Python fixtures, but no release build or GUI smoke tests.
- A fixed ignored candidate directory can preserve its own `target/` cache and keep runtime resource/catalog discovery rooted in the candidate. A shared target outside it could make the app discover the live project instead.
- The source checkout remains at the current baseline on 2026-09-06; use local Git fixtures to verify actual revision transitions.

## Fork feature takeover findings — 2026-09-08
- The MakeOS desktop style depends on seven changed widgets paths outside apps/wm. Pinning all crates to the published WM fork (now OctoSense-org/makepad, ff134865) provides these without vendoring framework code.
- The provenance baseline now uses the fork, with default_source the fork's sibling checkout. This checkout tracks official upstream/work locally, so the documented fork pull names origin work explicitly. Incorporating official updates into the fork remains the user's source Git workflow.
- Safe cached-view snapshots and wallpaper redraw are now provided by widgets; the temporary standalone WM implementations can be removed.
- Persistent widget-tree child enumeration is necessary for dynamically hosted apps: one-time insertion alone loses surviving entries when a sibling closes and the tree refreshes. A floating desk also needs its turtle area, not its tiling border's stale area.
- Successful screenshots alone do not detect skipped shaders; native smoke now rejects runtime shader/error logs as well as checking app input and state.

## Omarchy wallpaper — 2026-09-08
- MakeOS bundles Tokyo Night colors but no wallpaper and deliberately gates downloads behind --download-wallpapers. Its separate state directory has no Tokyo Night backgrounds. The old Makepad state has the original 0-winding-road.webp (653,482 bytes), first in the sorted wallpaper list.
- Keep installed-background discovery separate from the embedded fallback so explicit downloads still work. Style switching currently tests only installed files, so it must use the actual load result to expose the fallback.
- Async Image visibility precedes decoding. Native startup validation now waits for the rendered wallpaper frame; the default gradient is only a few KB, while the fixed photographic frame exceeds 50 KB. The SVG Image path does not expose a raster area in snapshots, so Omarchy visibility assertions are scoped to its raster wallpaper.

## Shared Qwen configuration — 2026-09-08
- The fork AI engine searches MAKEPAD_AI_CHAT_MODEL, then MAKEPAD_HOME/weights recursively, then checkout-local models. MakeOS sets child MAKEPAD_HOME to its separate state home. A symlink to the existing GGUF solves discovery without changing the app or sharing the full state home.
- The pinned aichat settings implementation still uses ~/.makepad/aichat/settings directly, independent of MAKEPAD_HOME. No settings file exists here, so defaults select Local and local-only; no settings were modified.
- Model inference through the hosted child passed; two automated host-pane input attempts failed to submit. Retain this separate input-routing observation for subsequent UI work.

- Contributor setup source verified on 2026-09-09: unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF revision 24fadbaba5891f3965d66ea0e2e4aa259cd38c77 publishes the tested file with SHA-256 6f5d30666c2d8ae16a306e616d95341dcf3cc46810df84d7e6f5a7d1e4c1b293; hashing the existing local GGUF produced the same digest. Source: https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF/blob/24fadbaba5891f3965d66ea0e2e4aa259cd38c77/Qwen3.5-9B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf

## 2026-09-11 official work intake
- Source is ../makepad work at 74b63be83; source checkout has unrelated untracked examples, which will be excluded.
- Recorded baseline is fork ff134865 (OctoSense-org/makepad); official checkout does not contain that object and lacks DesktopStyle::MakeOs. New wm library changes will stay in external crates where possible.
- Uncommitted Android/launcher changes are preserved under target/upstream-20260911/before with SHA-256 inventory; no commit or push requested.

- wm_api/wm_theme are byte-identical between old fork pin and official tip. Safe view snapshot/cached drawing APIs are present upstream; only MakeOS enum/theme/icon alias and SVG cover require local adapters.

- Real GPU tracing reproduces a freed draw-list root at platform/src/draw_list.rs:485 in prepare_retained_working_set. The pass iterator includes retired slots; a local pre-submit cleanup clears only invalid roots. Regression test fails before and passes after.
- Studio was split into public Director and private Scope upstream; catalog retains studio ID but uses makepad-director/director.
- Android APK builds, but adb devices is empty. iOS still fails in upstream with two missing methods.

## OctoSense rename
- Cargo package/binary and Reference package become octosense and octosense-reference; labels use OctoSense.
- Current ~/.makeos exists and holds the previously configured weights. Prefer OCTOSENSE_HOME and ~/.octosense, with legacy environment/state fallback so existing setup keeps working.
- Cargo Android packaging supports package.metadata.packager.product_name and identifier; set explicit OctoSense label and dev.makepad.octosense ID.
- Upstream original asset source paths/hashes must remain unchanged while local destinations move. Workspace directory and past validation artifacts remain at their real locations.
- Android packaging preserves the exact OctoSense label through product_name; it emits octo_sense.apk under the octosense build directory. The new dev.makepad.octosense ID installs separately from MakeOS.
- Native screenshots confirm the OctoSense shell name and Reference greeting render correctly; all eight style transitions preserve the hosted app.

## OctoSense light appearance — 2026-09-11
- OctoSense currently disables supports_dark and always loads the dark Splash palette, wire name and chrome. Enable the same light/dark convention as macOS: false is light, true is dark.
- Retain the existing glass geometry and dark theme. The light companion uses pearl surfaces, pale aqua shadows, dark ink text and blue accents; its wallpaper preserves the Abyssal Currents composition.
- Hosted apps receive complete style sheets through the upstream macOS wire family. New child processes must also receive the recognized macos/macos-dark environment value, rather than the local octosense identifier.
- The previous wallpaper smoke exposed upstream remote input applying before a capture error. The helper now retries only captures, never clicks/keys; regression coverage and native smoke passed.
- The proposed dependency/submodule migration was canceled; no dependency or sync mechanism changes are part of this work.

## App Hub — 2026-09-22
- User approved browse/search/details/install/open, close screenshot adaptation, and a separately labeled preview catalog.
- Hub source inspected at 97c2a1fd9aa49a6b87586f228e070e0c16b1067b; live signed catalog sequence 4 has no entries.
- Reuse Hub Store/Origin and contained Card module; preserve verification, freshness and withdrawal behavior.
- Existing remote feat/appstore-module offers integration examples but contains obsolete dependency paths and shared card identity; adapt rather than merge.
- User appstore screenshots and scripts image assets are untracked and must be preserved.
- image-to-appcard requires real native text/controls and separate artwork, measured reference provenance and actual capture review.
- App Hub needs Makepad's enforced Splash containment APIs. The explicit consumer override advances 825dbb422 to direct descendant 7786bb4a3 (containment commit and merge only), while the wrapper stays pinned at b0628d05. Setup verifies clean exact checkouts, all consumer pins and one framework Cargo graph.
- Installed shell identities use `hub:<manifest-id>` to prevent collisions with built-in names and preserve distinct recents entries. Launch checks run before focusing existing windows and never wait on a network refresh.
- The raster image cache cannot load SVG icons. App Hub loads bounded SVG bytes through the native vector parser; HTTP fetching remains asynchronous. Refresh retries failed artwork, and recycled rows clear their prior images.
- Native install/open validation exposed nested Splash theme replay losing font resources and Card vocabulary. Trusted stylesheet adaptation preserves required widget definitions without restoring ambient `mod.res` or `mod.run` authority.
- The shared Card host also reserves space for an empty notice and its lowered absolute coordinates assume a window origin. A local presentation adapter keeps shared verification/containment intact while mounting card coordinates below the shell status area and drawing custom shaders in the nested owner VM. Native captures verify both fixture apps and separate launcher/Recents entries.
- Nested Card events must run under their owner VM, including delivery to registered network callbacks. Regression tests cover callback completion, retained guest state and correctly mounted first frames after theme changes; native Controls-shade testing confirms the same restyle behavior.
- Store icon follow-up: App Hub's launcher and header resolve the same app-owned SVG through `listing.json` and `APP_ICON_SVG`. A bag silhouette with an enlarged 2×2 app grid gives a clearer store meaning than the previous Octo Bloom. Preserve the teal/ivory/mint palette, 64×64 canvas and existing tile padding; no motion or UI behavior changes. Pixel 7 Pro is connected for visual verification.
- Logo-in-bag refinement: the existing OctoSense mark is `apps/news/resources/icons/octosense.svg`, eight elliptical petals. Reuse its exact path geometry in the self-contained Hub SVG, scaled uniformly to 21 pixels and colored teal on the ivory bag. No generated approximation or new logo is needed.
- Author-guide audit: Hub gate checks listing icon presence, bundle-relative PNG/SVG path and file existence, but does not decode dimensions or run the UI. Mobile icon loader separately limits reads to 1 MiB, square geometry and PNG sides to 1024. Reference `card-host` uses RefuseAllSignatures and has no publisher-key CLI flag; its development walkthrough must use unsigned content. Its default window is 412×892 logical pixels, so the old fixed 812×1552 crop is unsuitable. AppCard guide paths verified against its remote main tree.
