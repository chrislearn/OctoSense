# OctosMap Android 9 HTTPS fix — 2026-09-23

- Added Android service-only reqwest/rustls transport with normal WebPKI certificate validation, HTTPS-only requests, redirects disabled, a streaming 4 MiB body cap, connect/total timeouts and cancellation on supersede/shutdown/drop. Replies wake the UI and cancelled replies are discarded.
- Added nine loopback TLS 1.3 regression tests. They caught certificate hostname errors being misclassified as DNS failures; certificate errors now take precedence. All 106 Maps tests pass; the local server tests required sandbox escalation for loopback sockets.
- Android release APK built successfully; SHA-256 `42b5b2b36d482659b1eaa3efeeacf97981ad91c338747df141775eaa0d08b905`. Installed successfully on OnePlus 6T without clearing app data.
- Device's earlier USB disconnect had removed the gnirehtet ADB reverse tunnel. Restored it with `gnirehtet tunnel 19f8cedf`; search then succeeded. SJC Airport Terminal A to SFO International Terminal routes draw in all modes: Drive 43 min / 34 mi, Walk 14 hr 24 min / 40 mi, Bike 3 hr 56 min / 34 mi. Driving preview advances with changing maneuvers, 3D tiles and remaining time. Ended preview and left driving directions open.
- Independent review found no actionable issues. Focused Makepad/AndroidRuntime error log has no entries. Verification artifacts are in `target/maps-tls-review/`; MAPS-17 marked resolved in the backlog and Maps docs.

- Created fix/maps-android9-tls from clean main 0d51947.
- Captured the SJC-to-SFO error on the OnePlus before changes. Forced TLS 1.2 handshake fails against routing.openstreetmap.de; a modern TLS request succeeds.

# OctosMap — 2026-09-18

- Investigated with read-only agents (two stalled and were rerun narrower): the route app and its data plane, the shell's module contract with News as the template, the AppCards `nav` card. Probed the services by hand.
- Asked the person six decisions up front, then ran unattended as asked.
- Task 1 spike: the hosted archive draws downtown San Jose with streets, buildings and labels; no second tile source needed.
- Tasks 2–7, each red then green: `geo` 12 tests, `places` 8, `routing` 7, `guidance` 7, `sheet` 6, `model` 17.
- Tasks 8–11, the view: 27 isolate tests with injected replies and fixes. Each screen looked at in the standalone window on live services. Synthetic clicks were unreliable on this desk, so the window opens on a state by flag (`--show`, `--fix`).
- Found and fixed on the way: a turn within the session's 3 m look-ahead of the start was never announced (OSRM sets off a metre before a corner); the chase paused with no finger on the screen, because `MapView` reports guidance's own camera moves too.
- Tasks 12–13: the settings and the last camera in the storage jail; 83 tests in the crate.
- Task 14: linked into the shell behind `app-maps` (unconditional on Android and iOS), both catalogs, the App Library, the launcher icons, the iOS location sentence. `cargo check --locked --workspace --features mobile-apps` and `tools/setup-native.py --check` pass.
- `mobile_island::tests::hidden_while_the_shade_is_pulled_or_open` fails on this branch and on `main` (`72d9614`) alike: not this work's, left alone.
- Task 16: opened in the phone shell on macOS, in-process (`--module maps --test-action launch-maps`, the shell's frame capture and its `taps:` action, an isolated `OCTOSENSE_HOME`). Found there and fixed: the sea was the page's colour (two ocean overlays), and the home icon was the generic one (the shell's icon wrapper draws the route app's art for `maps`).
- A whole-feature review and a pass of my own over the view: thirteen fixes, listed in the plan. The view's tests now fail on a run-time script error, which is how two broken padding updates would have been caught. 95 tests in the crate.
- The FOSSGIS routing server was down for a while during the review (refused from outside this network too); the app's error path was seen working on screen.
- Task 17, in part, on the OnePlus 6T: linked, launched in-process, GPS fix arrives, dock row as asked (News, OctosMap, Photos). Blocked by two framework problems found and traced there: no tiles on Android (MAPS-12) and a GL-backend panic that freezes the shell when the app opens (MAPS-13). Both are small fixes in the fork, which needs the person's decision.
- A temporary worktree used to check that on `main` shared the target directory and left Photos' build output pointing at it; `cargo clean -p octosense-photos` put it right. No source was touched.
- The person said to fix the fork bugs and that the app opened smaller than the others. Four commits on a local fork branch, `fix/android-map-archive` (not pushed): the GL backend's no-draw-list panic (which was also the smaller size: a frozen frame of the opening animation), Android's silent HTTP cancel, compact vertex formats on the native GL backend (roads and fills were skipped), and the navigation layer clearing a host's puck (missing on desktop too, missed earlier).
- On the OnePlus 6T with an APK built against that branch: opens full size, full map, Locate and puck, dropped pin and reverse lookup, search by soft keyboard, place sheet. Result distances now follow the result's country (a test, red first; 96 in the crate).
- Directions cannot be verified on this phone: the public router is TLS 1.3 only, Android 9 stops at 1.2 (MAPS-17). Pinch, rotate and tilt need fingers.
- Merged `origin/main`, pushed, and opened the pull requests: the fork's four fixes (`makepad#15`) and this branch as a draft (`#28`). Unshallowed the fork checkout and wrote up the fork, upstream and the shallow bootstrap in `docs/makepad-fork.md`.
- 2026-09-19: `makepad#15` merged; `Octoscript-Makepad#28` named the new revision and merged; the pin moved here (lock and six manifests, `Cargo.lock` unchanged). MAPS-12 to MAPS-16 closed. The consumer check fails in this directory only because of the `feat/photos` worktree under `.worktrees/`; it passes on a clean copy. The pinned APK ran on a Pixel 7 Pro (Android 17): all of the OnePlus checks in the dark skin, plus directions and the preview drive, which Android 9 cannot reach. Fixed from it: the navigation bar's time was unreadable in the dark skin (`Skin::go`, a contrast test, 97 in the crate). Mail, Sheets and AppCard open; the colour fix was seen on the phone. The AppCard nav card needs an APK with the assistant kernel and was not seen.
- 2026-09-19, at the person's request: new icons for News and OctosMap. Three directions each were drawn and shown; chosen were the red front page, with a small N added at their word, and the map under a pin. They are this shell's own SVGs in the framework's seven-style scheme (`tools/build_app_icons.py`, `resources/icons/apps/`), laid over the framework's list in `octosense::style::icon_assets`, so OctosMap no longer borrows the route app's art and no framework change was needed. Tests red first; seen in the phone shell on macOS.

# Photos royalty-free expansion — 2026-09-18

- Continued on isolated feat/photos worktree, preserving previous generated scenes and saved albums.
- Selected 32 Pexels images and recorded source URLs, photographers, license links and sample catalog metadata.
- Source HTML download returns HTTP 403; browser source records are available and image CDN download succeeds.
- Downloaded and visually reviewed all 32 JPEGs, maximum dimension 1200 px, total 5,459,488 bytes. All decode; source IDs and hashes are distinct.
- Integrated 75 total photos. Verified eight new dates per month June–September and byte-for-byte preservation of the existing 43 assets and metadata.
- All 21 Photos tests, formatting and whitespace checks pass. Android rebuild started for OnePlus 6T 19f8cedf.
- Android release build completed. All 32 exact JPEG byte sequences verified inside the APK, SHA-256 a5105b769737ce1287103c20e457788b165027ac7ec3ac19528fd1f587c88131.
- Installed with adb install -r and launched successfully on OnePlus 6T. Library visibly reports 75 photos; June has 9 total (8 new plus the original desert), September Memory has 8 new photos. Existing three albums and original favorite remain visible.
- App-process error log has no Makepad error, AndroidRuntime error or libc fatal entries. Device screenshots and validation report are in target/photos-stock-review/.
- Final publication verification: all 21 Photos tests pass again, all 75 image files decode, all 56 new manifest hashes match, original 19 images and metadata are unchanged. Independent review found no actionable issues; user requested commit and PR against main.

---

# Photos device run — 2026-09-18

- User requested running the latest Photos app on the device. OnePlus 6T 19f8cedf is connected and authorized. Existing installed package includes libmakepad.so only, with no bundled octos kernel.
- Used feat/photos with the 24 new images and matching sibling Makepad build tool. Initial Java packaging failed because the ignored contracts JAR was absent. Generated it via the existing Gradle 8.11.1/JDK 17/API 35 toolchain and cached dependencies; sandbox cache access required approved escalation. Rebuilt successfully.
- Verified all 24 exact PNG byte sequences are embedded in the APK. Backed up the previous APK and recorded both hashes. adb install -r succeeded, preserving app data; launched and opened Photos on OnePlus 6T 19f8cedf (PID 13012). Library visibly shows 43 photos, including the new scenes, with prior favorites still present.
- Evidence: target/photos-scenes-review/device/{build.log,contracts-build.log,apk-verification.json,photos-latest.apk,before.apk,home.png,photos-library.png}. Initial screenshot preceded rendering; the subsequent home and Photos captures show the app correctly.

# Photos everyday scenes progress — 2026-09-18

- Recovered clean feat/photos worktree and original six portraits.
- Read imagegen, planning-with-files and brainstorming guidance; user has specified the creative scope, so generation proceeds directly.
- Saved all 24 exact prompts, identity reference mappings and planned catalog records in generated-scenes.json.
- Generated and visually inspected the first 12 images: full bodies, consistent reference likenesses, believable office, school, garden, coast and stadium settings. Originals preserved.
- All 18 individual scenes generated and visually reviewed. Six group scenes are generating. Catalog and provenance now list the planned 24 additions.
- All 24 initial images generated. Visual review found two trio images too tight at the shoes and the beach group too tight at the top of the head; regenerate wider framing for these three only.
- Wider refinements for both trios and the four-person beach scene passed visual review. Selected files are copied into resources/photos; rejected framing drafts live only in ignored target/photos-scenes-review/drafts. Final hashes, reference hashes and refinement prompts are recorded.
- Final verification: 21 Photos tests pass; cargo fmt -p octosense-photos --check and git diff --check pass. All 43 assets decode, catalog IDs/files match exactly, original 19 assets and metadata are unchanged, the six reference portraits match scripts/individuals byte-for-byte, and all recorded SHA-256 hashes match.
- Final deliverables: 18 new solo PNGs at 1024×1536, 6 group PNGs at 1536×1024 (64.92 MiB total), catalog metadata, source provenance and exact prompts. No new Android build or installation was performed. Changes remain uncommitted on feat/photos.
- Previous Photos baseline: 21 tests pass. Main checkout contains unrelated ongoing Maps work and remains untouched.

# Photos continuation — 2026-09-17

- Ran the required Superpowers bootstrap and recovered the existing plan and notes.
- Checked the merged application state and connected Android device.
- Requested the user's preferred next direction while inspecting the existing implementation.
- Baseline Photos tests passed (12 total). Stated phone-photo import as the default
  next milestone after allowing time for the optional direction question.
- User clarified the next feature: Library zoom with mobile pinch and desktop
  scrolling, using the supplied Makepad Photos implementation as reference.
- Removed the preliminary import-only plan/test (its run failed on the missing
  import module as expected); no production import code or dependencies changed.
- TDD red: the four zoom tests plus a new view controller regression failed on the
  missing LibraryZoom/PinchTracker types, zoom fields and apply_zoom, as intended.
- Implemented bounded scale with density hysteresis, two-contact pinch tracking that
  holds the touch stream until the last finger lifts, nine reusable square grid cells,
  anchored reflow, wheel zoom over the grid only, and a desktop-only zoom slider.
- Green: 10 unit + 9 model/persistence + 2 UI/catalog tests pass, plus
  `cargo check --features mobile-only,app-photos --locked` and rustfmt.
- The maintainer tried the change on a device build and confirmed the zoom works.
  This session captured no new screenshots or device logs for it.
- Documented the gesture, the zoom module, and the stale `PortalList` drag-state
  caveat in `docs/photos.md`; committed the work on `feature/photos-zoom`.

# Photos app progress — 2026-09-16

- Asked three initial product questions before implementation. Read brainstorming, frontend, and planning skills. Began screenshot and architecture research.
- Preserved the historical planning records and recorded the new Photos task separately.
- All three product choices are confirmed. Inspected the five App Store screenshots and documented the native module design in `docs/plans/2026-09-16-photos.md`.
- Added the Photos crate and test-first model API. Initial run failed on the five missing behaviors as expected; implemented albums, favorites, catalog reconciliation/search, and deterministic Memories. All 7 model tests now pass.
- Bundled 19 catalog photos: 6 generated individual portraits, the group photo, and 12 landscape/nature samples. Original image files remain unchanged.
- Cargo offline resolution initially lacked the pinned Git revision; approved normal Cargo resolution succeeded. The runtime verifier needed sandbox escalation for Cargo cache access. One sample URL returned 404 and was replaced with a working photo.

- Implemented the native Collections/Library/editor/viewer UI and local shell integration. Added UI initialization and embedded-catalog tests; these caught enum/import issues before device installation.
- Saved the currently installed APK to `target/photos-validation/octosense-before.apk`. It contains only `libmakepad.so` (no bundled octos kernel). Located an existing Android SDK/NDK and started the full shell build.

- Android release build succeeded and was installed with `adb install -r`, preserving app data. Tested native Library/Collections, scrolling, viewer next/previous/swipe, favorites, metadata search, People, album creation/rename/membership/cancel/delete, and Memory advance/pause.
- User asked for centered text/icons and no separate ADB permission prompts. Continued with existing ADB authorization. Replaced missing text glyphs with SVG icons; centered controls, People labels, and Memory captions. Fixed inherited Label padding that clipped captions, grid sizing from the active list layout, empty image cells, group-photo crops, and selected navigation surfaces.
- Verified album/favorite persistence across force-stop/restart and APK replacements. Removed the temporary test album and favorite afterward. Automatic Memory frames advanced from 1/7 to 2/7; paused screenshots were byte-identical across 3.5 seconds.
- Final verification: 8 model/persistence tests + 2 UI/catalog tests passed; bundled-module registry test passed; `cargo check --features mobile-only,app-photos --offline` passed; shared runtime graph check passed; Android release APK built successfully. No app errors/panics/shader failures in the captured final process logs.
- Added `docs/photos.md`, image provenance, README entry, and instructions for extending the photo catalog. Verified all seven family asset copies match their original SHA-256 hashes. Formatting/whitespace checks pass. Device screenshots and logs are under `target/photos-validation/`; the final app is installed and left on Collections. No commits or pushes were made.

# MakeOS progress (historical)

## 2026-09-04 — Scoping
- Ran the requested Superpowers bootstrap.
- Loaded planning-with-files and brainstorming instructions.
- Confirmed destination directory is empty.
- Created planning notes; application implementation has not started.
- Identified exact source revision, binary-only package, direct dependencies, optional bundled apps, and escaping font paths.
- Asked which app-hosting mode should define the initial milestone; investigation continues independently.
- Finished tracked file inventory and inspected launch policy, startup side effects, theme/resource loading, and reusable app APIs.
- Ran read-only Cargo metadata successfully. No compilation or GUI validation has been performed.
- Checked official Cargo dependency and patch documentation; live remote revision verification remains an implementation preflight gate.
- Wrote `docs/plans/2026-09-04-makeos-extraction.md` as a discussion draft covering dependency alternatives, import inventory, exact adaptation areas, reference app delivery, three-way upstream sync, and runtime acceptance checks.
- No implementation, GUI launch, source-checkout mutation, or Git initialization was performed.

## Implementation
- User approved the proposed first milestone.
- Re-read plan and loaded executing-plans, TDD, and worktree guidance. This new root has no existing Git history or code to isolate; implementing directly in the requested directory.
- Verified the pinned upstream WM manifest can be downloaded from GitHub successfully.
- Imported 69 WM files and the original license notice; wrote source mappings/hashes and pinned external dependencies. Cargo fetch/resolution succeeded.
- Added MakeOS app catalog parser, state paths, explicit optional startup flags, and reference app. Repaired named-crate font paths and trimmed visible menu to supported operations.
- TDD: observed four catalog/state tests and launch-binary selection test fail, then pass after implementation.
- Full Rust test run: 159 passed after adapting source-catalog fixtures and menu expectations.
- Release host and reference app built successfully. Launched host with isolated state and its remote control; frame shows desktop/bar/icons correctly, no missing-resource log messages. Closed that instance through /gq.
- Maintenance agent implemented safe staged upstream comparison/update, with 24 offline fixture tests passing.
- Independent review identified lifecycle/diagnostic issues; reviewer is implementing bounded fixes while main session prepares runtime verification and documentation.
- Review fixes completed: synchronous final client-group shutdown, group escalation after wrapper exit, and startup-failure notification/logging. Final Rust suite: 163 passed.
- Live GUI regression found the run-view widget reporting its retired startup backdrop's area. Marking the live surface area fixed inspection after startup; expanded native smoke checks passed.
- Release smoke verified pointer/text forwarding, workspace relocation, fullscreen geometry, two independent instances, individual close, failed Cargo launch, and host quit during a deliberately unfinished build. All observed process groups were reaped.
- Exact `cargo run` with the shipped catalog passed in the repository and in an independent temporary copy with its own target directory. Initial remote dependency resolution was online; subsequent smoke checks used offline Cargo with cached dependencies.
- Maintenance suite: 24 passed. Baseline status verified all 70 imports and Cargo pins: 11 adapted, 59 unchanged. Source checkout retains only its four pre-existing untracked example directories.
- Added README, runtime smoke script, validation record, and maintenance/conflict-recovery documentation.
- Final inventory: 90 project files, including the 70 mapped upstream imports. Git whitespace check passed. Both final smoke modes passed; implementation and validation are complete.

## 2026-09-06 — Daily sync automation
- User requested one command after their source Git update, automating steps 2–4 and leaving step 5 to them.
- Source HEAD still equals the imported baseline; the live checkout can exercise the fast no-op path.
- Existing updater stages safely but discards build artifacts and requires separate smoke commands. Extending it with a cached sync workflow and retained review reports.
- Added `python3 scripts/upstream.py sync`, using sibling HEAD, fast no-op, persistent candidate build cache, per-attempt reports, and unique review branches created only after checks pass. No automatic Git commits or source fetches.
- New regressions cover cache reuse, branch collisions, conflicts, failed checks, concurrent branch changes, lock contention, and CLI defaults. Full suite: 40 script tests passed.
- Review caught interruption cleanup and failure-archive errors bypassing branch restoration. Both regressions failed before fixes and passed afterward; bounded follow-up review found no additional material defects.
- Full real verifier passed on an isolated source copy with seeded compilation caches: metadata, workspace check, 163 Rust tests, 40 script tests, release/debug builds, and both native GUI smoke modes. Captured frames and host/client logs were copied into the run's report.
- Actual source HEAD remains at the pinned baseline. Live CLI sync correctly returned a no-op and reported these uncommitted automation edits separately. No upstream revision or Git history was changed.
- Updated daily usage and recovery docs. Automation changes remain uncommitted for user review.

## 2026-09-08 — Resolve upstream sync conflicts
- Synced from the local Makepad commit ae20efc5 in a disposable candidate; the live main branch stayed clean during resolution and verification.
- Resolved catalog, Cargo progress/diagnostics, startup style, and menu overlaps while retaining MakeOS policies.
- Independent review caught unavailable mobile app shortcuts and background tile launches; fixed and covered catalog menu/layout regressions.
- Adapted the WM-owned rendering cache to missing View APIs in the pinned external widgets crate, preserving the minimal source footprint.
- Locked workspace check, 191 Rust tests, 40 Python tests, release/debug builds, and both native smoke modes passed. Artifacts and compatibility details are recorded in docs/validation.md.
- Additional native style checks passed across desktop and phone layouts; the reference process/state survived with no background launches. Reviewed rendered frames for desktop, macOS, iOS, and Android.

## 2026-09-08 — Adopt fork WM features
- Fast-forwarded local main from f157660 to 8b2dc9c before feature work; only one completed sync branch needed integration.
- Imported WM changes at published fork ff134865 (OctoSense-org/makepad) through a conflict-free three-way merge, retaining standalone policies and moving all external Makepad pins together.
- Added StyleSpec, MakeOS Liquid Glass, theme/material parsing, rounded process surfaces and bundled wallpaper. Replaced local rendering workarounds with the now-available widgets APIs.
- Recorded the fork baseline/default checkout; daily sync retains the same review handoff and now exercises all styles. Added regressions for source selection, nested worktree exclusion and runtime error detection.
- Native glass input validation exposed inherited desk geometry/dynamic-child discovery issues; fixed with explicit WidgetNode enumeration and a regression test.
- Verification passed: 205 Rust tests, 44 Python tests, both profile builds, all-style release smoke and exact cargo run smoke. Frames reviewed for glass windows, dock, bar, menus, calendar and notifications. See docs/validation.md.
- Preparing the verified import commit and local main integration; no pushes or source-checkout changes.

## 2026-09-08 — Omarchy startup wallpaper
- Preserving uncommitted full app catalog and README changes. Traced the missing image to the extracted app’s offline startup policy and absent bundled Omarchy asset.

- Native reproduction failed as expected: bg_image was hidden with a zero rectangle; saved blank frame in target/wallpaper-validation/before. Verified cached image Git blob matches Omarchy upstream, then embedded the unmodified file with source/license record. Installed discovery remains unchanged so explicit downloads are not suppressed.
- Inspection hiccups: unquoted URL/glob caused zsh errors; corrected quoting. Sandbox DNS required curl escalation. API response included image bytes; subsequent downloads saved directly to artifact files.

- 205 Rust and 44 Python tests passed. Updated two obsolete Reference-only catalog tests to preserve Reference and validate package/binary targets through Cargo workspace metadata; first edit used incorrect JSON helper names, corrected to the local parse/as_arr API.
- Exact cargo run and hosted Reference interactions passed. Startup capture raced asynchronous decoding, so the smoke now waits for a detailed rendered frame. A MakeOS SVG visibility assertion was invalid because its widget snapshot has no raster area despite the SVG drawing correctly; limited that new assertion to the Omarchy raster path. Native frames confirmed the SVG and later Omarchy raster render.

- Final verification passed: release all-style smoke (including repeated MakeOS/Omarchy, Reference state/input and shutdown cleanup) and exact cargo run with the full default catalog. Reviewed decoded startup and return-to-Omarchy frames. All test instances were closed. Source checkouts unchanged; catalog plus wallpaper changes remain uncommitted on main.

## 2026-09-08 — Reuse the fork’s local Qwen model
- Committed the app catalog and wallpaper changes as 03224eb on main; working tree was clean immediately afterward.
- Found the existing 5.6 GiB Qwen3.5-9B GGUF in Makepad state and linked it into MakeOS weights after filesystem approval. The fork already defaults to the Local provider with local-only enabled; no settings file was present.
- Verified that the hosted assistant selects Qwen and produces a local reply from the linked file. Model test used the child remote endpoint after two host-pane input probes did not submit text; no claim of verified pane input routing. All owned test processes exited. README/setup and validation documentation remain uncommitted.

## 2026-09-09 — Document local AI setup for contributors
- Added docs/local-ai.md and a README entry covering per-user weights outside Git, assistant source setup at the recorded revision, a pinned model download with checksum validation, existing-file reuse, custom paths and verification. Added ignore rules for GGUFs and partial downloads.
- Verified the installed GGUF SHA-256 matches the publisher’s pinned file. Checked all four shell command blocks with bash -n, checked ignore behavior and ran git diff --check. No model download, source build, GUI launch or personal-state change was needed for this documentation update.

## 2026-09-11 — Update from official work
- Bootstrapped skills, inspected both repo states, saved local source snapshot and inventory. Assessing framework compatibility before changing the live code.

- Candidate pins now fetch the published official revision successfully. Common-ancestor WM diff is only the Studio catalog rename; fork additions are retained as local changes.

- Candidate Rust tests 216 passed, Python maintenance 44 passed. Added 3 remote input retry tests and a real draw-list retirement regression. Release GPU smoke exposed upstream stale pass roots; fixing with local public-API adapter.

- Applied 28 integration files on main after checking their live contents against the starting dirty snapshot. No staging or commit. Latest validation: 217 Rust tests, 48 Python tests, all-style GPU smoke, default cargo-run catalog smoke, and Android APK build passed. iOS upstream errors and absent ADB device documented.

- Final live workspace all-features locked check passed. Daily sync reports already at the recorded official revision; applied file hashes match the verified candidate.

## OctoSense rename
- Started from clean main at 9da3b28. Inventoried Cargo, shell labels, local modules/resources, catalog, state paths, sync scripts and docs.
- Renamed packages, modules/resources, custom style, shell/catalog/log labels, packaging metadata, scripts and active docs. Preserved upstream source paths/hashes and access to legacy state/model links.
- Verification passed: locked metadata/check, 218 Rust tests, 48 Python tests, release/debug workspace builds, all-style native smoke, plain cargo-run default-catalog smoke, Android APK/manifest and sync integrity. No connected Android device. Changes remain uncommitted on main.

## OctoSense wallpaper and light appearance — 2026-09-11
- Working on feat/desktop-wallpaper; preserving the untracked repository instructions. Bundled the original dark Abyssal Currents PNG, retired the custom SVG renderer and kept Android's animation. Documented source prompt and provenance.
- Dark wallpaper checks passed: 217 Rust tests, 49 Python tests, release build and all-style native smoke with Reference interaction. Fixed the smoke helper's duplicate input retries after capture failures.
- User requested a light counterpart. Inspected appearance routing, palette loading and glass chrome; adding light resources and enabling the existing appearance controls next.
- Generated the light wallpaper as an edit of the original; saved both native PNGs and full prompts locally. Enabled OctoSense Light/Dark, paired the wallpaper cache keys, and made new child processes use recognized upstream appearance names.
- Shell bar, calendar, notifications, menus and controls now derive their colors from the same local palette, preserving the base Omarchy tokens. Original fork dark theme hashes still match.
- The new wire/reload test failed on the forced macos-dark name before implementation. Updated a stale ground-gradient fixture after the first full test run. Verification now passes 219 Rust tests, 49 Python tests and the locked release build; native all-style smoke is running.
- Native all-style smoke passed with both OctoSense appearances. Inspected light/dark menus, calendar, notifications and Android-style frames. A focused probe verified actual top-bar clicks, new apps in each appearance and retained counter state. All test processes stopped, with clean host/client rendering logs.
- Documented appearance selection, both native assets/prompts, upstream ownership and validation. Work remains uncommitted on feat/desktop-wallpaper; no dependency migration, framework changes or Android device build.
- User requested check-in and a PR. Preparing the verified feature changes for OctoSense-org/OctoSense main; preserving the pre-existing AGENTS.md locally.

## App Hub — 2026-09-22
- Merged swipe branch removed locally/remotely; main at 10c815c, feature branch renamed feat/app-hub.
- Completed source/reference research and all three clarifications. Implementation begins with native module plus pinned Hub service.
- Implemented verified catalog/cache service, consent-bound staged installation, withdrawal handling, source-separated preview and native Today/Apps/Search/Library/details screens. Spec and quality reviews resolved catalog persistence, stale consent, launch identity, blocking UI work and artwork retry findings.
- Completed atlas intake with the requested lab workflow; documented generated reference provenance, measured dimensions, semantic native mappings and intentional deviations. Saved actual 412×892 native shell captures and receipts in docs/design/app-hub/evidence.
- Native walkthrough verifies production empty state, preview browsing/search/details, local signed fixture permission confirmation/install/Library, and built-in Photos opening from list and detail. Both installed Card apps render inside the shell with separate launcher/Recents identities. A live dark-mode change preserves the Card content and position; App Hub retains active navigation and wrapped detail text.
- Checks passed: 33 App Hub tests, 2 signed fixture tests, 15 native setup tests, 293 shell tests with all mobile features, locked workspace check and final Android APK build. Fixed the existing shade-animation test fixture's AppCard producer identity so real idle-turn polling does not invalidate a geometry test under mobile-apps.
- Resolved all review findings, including nested Card event/callback delivery, state-preserving style replay and first-frame positioning. Saved final screenshots and source/artifact hashes in docs/design/app-hub/validation.json. Changes remain uncommitted on feat/app-hub.
- ADB currently lists no device; physical-phone install and visual acceptance remain unavailable.
- Local-launch follow-up: the original verification enabled `app-hub` explicitly, while the documented `mobile-only` command omitted it. Enabled App Hub in default features. The documented command now shows its All apps icon and opens the real store without module flags; 289 tests pass in this configuration. See docs/design/app-hub/local-launch-validation.json.
- Icon follow-up: adopted shared launcher identities for preview rows/details, removed duplicate glyphs, and refined the selected Octo Bloom with a central app grid. App Hub owns assets/icon.svg through listing.json; installed app artwork now comes from bounded local listing assets. Existing built-in theme files remain in place during the agreed gradual migration.
- Installed the updated APK on the connected Pixel 7 Pro, preserving its data. Verified live catalog empty state, matching preview icons, Photos search/details and opening Photos. Desktop fixture icons now match in Hub and launcher. 35 App Hub tests, 293 shell tests, release desktop and Android builds passed. Device/icon evidence is in docs/design/app-hub/icon-validation.json.
- Store icon follow-up: user requested a hub/store symbol beyond the OctoSense logo. Replaced the shared SVG with an ivory shopping bag, mint handle and four prominent app tiles on the existing teal background. Small-size rendering and Android visual verification are in progress.
- Store icon verification complete: reviewed at 112/64/48/32/24 pixels on light and dark backgrounds; 35 App Hub tests and the Android release build passed. Installed with `adb install -r`, preserving data. Pixel 7 Pro dock and App Hub header show the new icon; opening from the dock works. Evidence and hashes are in `docs/design/app-hub/store-icon-validation.json`. Historical bloom receipts remain unchanged; no commits or pushes.
- Logo-in-bag refinement: replaced the four app tiles with the exact eight-petal OctoSense logo from the News asset. Retained the bag shape, mint handle and teal tile. Reviewed at 112/64/48/32/24 pixels on light and dark backgrounds; Android rebuild and library checks are running.
- Logo-in-bag verification complete: 35 App Hub tests and Android release build passed. APK installed on Pixel 7 Pro with data retained; dock icon, opening App Hub and matching header checked. Original logo path equality verified. Evidence is in `docs/design/app-hub/store-logo-validation.json`; older receipts remain unchanged. Changes remain uncommitted.
- Author guide work: user authorized centralizing icon rules and linking the existing app-development guides. Created the missing sibling `OctoSense-App-Hub` checkout for shared docs. Inspecting the gate and reference host before writing a first-app walkthrough and scaffold.
- Author guides complete in sibling Hub branch `docs/app-author-guides`: added `docs/ICONS.md`, `docs/FIRST-APP.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `templates/app/` with complete metadata, an example icon and linked `AGENTS.md`. Updated Hub README/publishing and mobile entry points; local icon notes now defer shared rules to the Hub.
- Guide validation: built release `hub` and `card-host`; untouched stamped starter refused solely for its missing screenshot. A temporary known Card fixture with starter metadata rendered in a hidden native window, produced a real screenshot, then passed stamp/check/scan/signature verification. Test process exited and temporary signing key was removed. Checked 47 guide links, 8 shell blocks, 2 JSON examples and 2 metadata files; template SVG parsed/rendered. No production publish or catalog mutation. Guides remain uncommitted locally; main-branch web links go live when the Hub documentation is published.
- Validation hiccups resolved: GitHub tree lookup needed network escalation; the offline Cargo cache lacked `cc`, downloaded in the online build. Corrected a temporary fixture's missing assets directory and an application-script parent path. Replaced invalid angle-bracket placeholders in the old signing example with quoted variables. An exploratory fixture glob used the wrong directory; subsequent checks used the actual fixture path.

## App Hub PR preparation — 2026-09-23
- User authorized committing all changes and submitting PRs in both repositories. Included the previously untracked generated family portraits and their source prompts in a separate mobile commit.
- Independent mobile and guide reviews completed. Fixed the remaining mobile review finding: a successful update now closes that app's old module instances before reopening. A process-owned completion queue survives closing App Hub while its download finishes; failed installs and other apps remain unaffected.
- Observed the lifecycle and closed-view regressions fail before their fixes. Final checks passed: 294 shell tests with all mobile apps, 36 App Hub library tests, 2 signed fixture tests, 15 setup tests, 42 Hub/policy tests and the Android release APK build. Focused follow-up review reported no findings.
- Earlier Pixel 7 Pro screenshots validate the shopping bag icon and store flows. The final lifecycle fix is covered by automated native-isolate tests and a new Android build; this final APK was not reinstalled on the device.
