# OctoSense

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

[OctoSense](https://github.com/OctoSense-org) is an agent shell on top of your operating system: a launcher and apps that look like the ones you know, with one agent behind them. This repository holds all of OctoSense's own code in one place ([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-one-octosense-repository.md)): the shell, its services, the first-party system apps, and the three products built from them.

| Product | What it is | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OctoSense desktop** | The shell as one Makepad window on macOS (Windows and Linux untested): launcher, dock, tiles, hosted apps | [`desktop/`](desktop/README.md) |
| **OctoSense Home** | The phone shell, an ordinary Home app for any Android phone (also OpenHarmony and the iOS simulator) | [`phone/`](phone/README.md) |
| **OctoSense ROM** | LineageOS 22.2 for the OnePlus 6 with Home, the privileged system bridge, Quickstep and SystemUI preinstalled | [`rom/`](rom/README.md) |

It was OctoSense-Desktop; OctoSense-ROM (retired; merged into this repository) and OctoSense-System-Apps were imported into it with their history on 2026-09-27. OctoSense-System-Apps is archived; the OctoSense-ROM repository no longer exists.

> **Building an OctoSense app?** You do not need this repository to build, check or publish one. Start at the [OctoSense-org profile](https://github.com/OctoSense-org)'s reading list: [OctoScript-App-Design-Flow](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-App-Design-Flow) (`AGENTS.md`, then `docs/QUICKSTART.md`) and [OctoSense-App-Hub](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub). The system apps in [`apps/`](apps/README.md) are complete examples of the same app shape (`apps/<name>/bundle/`). Build the desktop shell from here only to see your app in a shell before it is published ([PUBLISHING §4](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-App-Design-Flow/blob/main/docs/PUBLISHING.md#4-rehearse-the-store-path-locally)).

## How it fits together

```
 person ──> OctoSense shell (one process) ──── OUP (stdio) ────> octos kernel (one per shell)
            ├─ native modules: App Hub, Rinx          ├─ system agent session
            ├─ Card runner: script apps in isolates   └─ one app agent (peer) per (app, account)
            ├─ approval router, host sheets, storage
            └─ hub ──> process apps (desktop: Terminal)
```

- **One shell process** hosts the window manager, the native modules (App Hub, Rinx) and App Hub's Card runner, where every script app runs in its own isolate. On the desktop the Terminal runs as its own process, attached over the shell's hub.
- **One octos kernel per shell**, started on first use: a child process on the desktop and Android, in process on OpenHarmony, none on iOS. The shell is its host connection and holds the host token; apps never talk to the kernel.
- **Agents are sessions in that kernel**: the system agent, and one app agent (an octos peer) per app and account, each with its own workspace, memory and transcript. The system agent briefs app agents and reads their results on the peers' blackboard.
- **Apps reach their agent through the shell**: an injected service for native modules, `host.request("octos.*")` for script apps. Talk to Octos (opt-in) lets a web or terminal client use the system conversation with a limited token, never the app agents.
- **The person approves**: outward and destructive tool calls go through the shell's approval router, live on a sheet or by a standing rule the person set.

Processes, agents, protocols, tools, approvals, storage and trust boundaries, with what is on `main` and what is planned: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`desktop/`](desktop/README.md) | Desktop packaging, package `octosense`: the entry point (`src/main.rs` only), catalogs (`config/apps.json`), the window-manager sync from upstream Makepad (`upstream/`, `scripts/upstream.py`), the desktop's system-app selection. |
| [`phone/`](phone/README.md) | The Home app, package `octosense-home` (APK id `dev.makepad.octosense`): the entry point that wraps the shell (`src/main.rs`), the built-in Settings app (`src/settings_*.rs`, `src/android_settings.rs`, `resources/settings/`), Android, OpenHarmony and iOS packaging, the phone side of the system bridge (`android/`), the phone's system-app selection. |
| [`rom/`](rom/README.md) | The OnePlus 6 ROM image only: `vendor/` (product, privileged permissions, overlays, Settings backends, the privileged agent), `patches/`, image, flash and OTA scripts, the Home APK build scripts, `web-installer/`, product tests. |
| `crates/shell/` | The one shell, package `octosense-shell`, linked by both packages: window manager (desk, styles, tiling, scene), hosting (processes, in-process modules, App Hub, the AI pane), the phone layer (home pages, shade, gestures, the Android launcher bridge), themes, wallpapers and icons (`resources/`). |
| [`crates/ai-host/`](crates/ai-host/README.md) | The shell's AI services behind one entry point, package `octosense-ai-host`: the octos kernel service, the `llm` host service with the platform's QR import, and apps' assistant access. |
| [`crates/kernel/`](crates/kernel/README.md) | The octos kernel service, package `octosense-kernel`: the [octos](https://github.com/octos-org/octos) agent kernel as a shell service, one per process, configured by AI providers and shared by its consumers. |
| [`crates/app-peers/`](crates/app-peers/README.md) | The app-agent broker: apps' access to the assistant ([Rinx ADR 0007](https://github.com/hagency-org/Rinx/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-host-owned-octos-app-peers.md)). |
| [`apps/`](apps/README.md) | The system apps (News, Photos, Maps, Camera, Mail, AI providers, YouTube) as contained script apps, their host services (`mail`, `llm`), `apps/reference`, and the opt-in AppCard assistant (`apps/appcard`). |
| `tools/` | `setup.py` (the pinned framework sources), the reviewed Makepad runtime patch (`runtime-patches/`), `kernel-artifact.py` (the octos kernel an Android APK bundles as `liboctos.so`), `check-shell-graph.sh` (the dependency-graph guards every shell build passes). |
| [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/README.md) | Architecture decisions: this repository's, and the Home decisions 0001–0006 kept as history. |
| `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` | One workspace. Every external dependency is pinned once in `[workspace.dependencies]`. |
| `native-runtime.lock.json`, `runtime-patches.lock.json` | The OctoScript-Makepad release (and through it Makepad and OctoScript), and the reviewed patch on top of Makepad. |

The shell exists once, in `crates/shell` ([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-one-octosense-repository.md)): desktop and phone differ by target and features, not by copies of the source. CI fails if a shell source file appears in two crates.

## What it depends on

Pinned exactly once, in the root `Cargo.toml` and the runtime locks:

| Repository | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [makepad (OctoSense fork)](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/makepad) | The UI framework and the `cargo-makepad` packager. Checked out in `.sources/makepad`, plus the reviewed runtime patch. |
| [OctoScript-Makepad](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-Makepad), [OctoScript](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript) | The runtime release that names the Makepad and OctoScript revisions (`native-runtime.lock.json`). |
| [OctoSense-App-Hub](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub) | The signed catalog, the store, the Card runner that contains every app (`octosense-app-hub-app`). |
| [octos](https://github.com/octos-org/octos) | The agent kernel. On Android the APK bundles it as `liboctos.so`; on a desktop the kernel service runs the binary named by `OCTOS_APP_CORE_BIN`. |
| [Rinx](https://github.com/hagency-org/Rinx) | Matrix chats and mini apps, hosted as a native module. |

Related, not build inputs: [OctoScript-App-Design-Flow](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-App-Design-Flow) (how apps are built and published), [OctoScript-Android](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-Android) and [OctoScript-OH](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-OH) (other renderers), the [OctoSense website](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/octosense-org.github.io).

## AI services (octos)

Each shell runs one [octos](https://github.com/octos-org/octos) agent kernel, started on first use: the APK's `liboctos.so` on Android, in process on OpenHarmony, the binary `OCTOS_APP_CORE_BIN` names on a desktop, none on iOS. The person chooses its models and types keys in the **AI providers** system app, on host sheets; keys stay in the platform's secret store and never reach an app. [`crates/ai-host`](crates/ai-host/README.md) is the shells' one entry point, and [`crates/app-peers`](crates/app-peers/README.md) gives each granted native app its own octos peer (private contexts, workspace and memory `app/<app>/acct-<hash>`), owned by the shell's system agent. A peer's tool approvals are answered only by the person, in that app; the system agent cannot answer them.

What works today: native modules (Rinx) use their peer; AppCard (opt-in) uses the kernel directly. Contained script apps, system or store, reach it through the `octos` host service in a shell that hosts a kernel: each app gets its own host-owned peer (`card.<app id>`), and tool approvals are declined until the Card runner has an approval sheet. The `llm` service manages providers for `os.*` apps only. An app's own agent (`tools.json`, `AGENT.md`, skills, triggers, glance cards) is [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-event-driven-app-agents.md), Proposed, with its first pieces merged or in review.

The architecture, the trust model, what each kind of app can use, the plan with its status, and how to run and test it locally: [docs/ai-services.md](docs/ai-services.md). How it fits into the whole system: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md). For app developers: OctoScript-App-Design-Flow's [AI-SERVICES](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-App-Design-Flow/blob/main/docs/AI-SERVICES.md).

## Set up

Stable Rust (`cargo` in `~/.cargo/bin`), Git, Python 3.9+ (3.11 for `desktop/scripts/upstream.py`) and, on macOS, the Xcode Command Line Tools. Makepad and OctoScript resolve to checkouts in `.sources/` (git-ignored) that the setup script prepares at the pinned revisions:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense.git
cd OctoSense
python3 tools/setup.py                  # prepare .sources/ (makepad, octoscript, octoscript-makepad)
python3 tools/setup.py --check --cargo  # verify: one Makepad, App Hub, octos and Rinx in the graph
```

`--update` moves clean checkouts after the locks change; `--cache DIR` borrows Git objects from existing clones (`DIR/makepad`, `DIR/octoscript`, `DIR/octoscript-makepad`). Local changes in `.sources/` are preserved.

**Already have clones of these repositories?** Keep one clone of each on the machine and make every `.sources/` entry a `git worktree` of it, so there is one object store per repository and no stale copy. Name the directory that holds the clones (as `<dir>/makepad`, `<dir>/octoscript`, `<dir>/octoscript-makepad`) once, in `~/.config/octosense/sources.json`:

```json
{ "hub": "/path/to/clones" }
```

or per run with `--hub DIR` or `OCTOSENSE_SOURCES_HUB=DIR`; `OCTOSENSE_MAKEPAD_HUB=CLONE` (and `_OCTOSCRIPT_`, `_OCTOSCRIPT_MAKEPAD_`) names one clone, as does `"repositories": {"makepad": "CLONE"}` in the file. Setup then fetches each pinned revision into that clone and runs `git worktree add --detach .sources/<name> <rev>` instead of cloning; `--update` moves the worktrees. Without a hub (CI, a fresh machine) it clones as before, and `--no-hub` forces that. A `.sources/` entry that is already a full clone is reported, not deleted; `--convert` replaces it with a worktree when it holds no local work.

Before deleting a checkout of this repository, remove its `.sources/` worktrees so the clones keep no stale entries:

```sh
python3 tools/setup.py --remove-worktrees   # git worktree remove + prune in each clone; stops on local work
git worktree remove <this checkout>         # if it is itself a worktree
```

By hand, the same is `git -C <clone> worktree remove --force .sources/<name>` (the reviewed Makepad patch is staged, hence `--force`; check `git status` first) and `git -C <clone> worktree prune`.

## Build

**Desktop** (from the root or `desktop/`; details in [desktop/README.md](desktop/README.md)):

```sh
cargo run --release -p octosense
cargo check --locked -p octosense --features mobile-apps                        # the set phones link
cargo check --locked -p octosense -p octosense-appcard --features mobile-apps,app-appcard
```

**Phone** (from `phone/`, which selects the phone's system apps; details in [phone/README.md](phone/README.md)):

```sh
cd phone
cargo run --release -p octosense-home --features mobile-only    # Home in a phone-sized window
cargo check --locked -p octosense-home --features mobile-apps
python3 ../rom/scripts/build-home.py --help                     # the Home and Bridge APK pair, liboctos.so bundled
```

**ROM image** (Linux build host, external LineageOS tree; not in CI): [rom/README.md](rom/README.md).

Hosted apps and UI tests run with hidden windows and a local control surface: `MAKEPAD_HIDE_WINDOWS=1 MAKEPAD_REMOTE=<port>` (routes under `/help`).

## CI

Path-filtered workflows in `.github/workflows/`, so a change runs only the jobs its paths need:

| Workflow | Runs for | Checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop.yml` | `desktop/`, `crates/`, `apps/`, the workspace files, `tools/` | compiles the desktop (default, `mobile-apps`, `mobile-apps,app-appcard`), the shell graph guards (`tools/check-shell-graph.sh`), one copy of every shell source, the `tools/` tests |
| `phone.yml` | `phone/`, `crates/`, `apps/`, the workspace files, `tools/` | compiles Home and its bundled modules, the shell graph guards, and runs the tests of the shell, Home, the AI services, App Hub admission and runtime policy on macOS; the longest job |
| `apps.yml` | `apps/`, `crates/`, the workspace files, `tools/setup.py` | the kernel service, app peers, AI providers config, the Mail and `llm` host services, the shell's AI services (`crates/ai-host`), AppCard |
| `rom.yml` | `rom/`, `phone/android/`, the phone's Android resources and tests, `tools/kernel-artifact.py` | product tests, the generated Agent Binder client, the web installer |

Each workflow's graph check (`tools/setup.py --check --cargo`) asserts one Makepad, one App Hub, one octos and one Rinx in the locked graph.

## Releases

ADR 0001 tags each product on its own: `desktop-v*`, `home-v*` (APK), `rom-v*` (image), with build receipts that record the repository commit. System apps ship only inside the shells, admitted by digest; they are not released separately. The ROM release published before the merge, `20260919-j`, is here as [`rom-v20260919-j`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/releases/tag/rom-v20260919-j). Phones read `update.json` from the moving `rom-latest` release, not from `releases/latest` ([rom/docs/updates.md](rom/docs/updates.md)). Images `20260919-j` and earlier check the retired OctoSense-ROM repository instead, so a phone flashed with one must be reflashed once to receive updates over the air.

## Contributing

`main` is protected: every change goes through a pull request, and force pushes are blocked. One change is one pull request, across `desktop/`, `phone/`, `crates/` and `apps/` as needed; there are no internal pins to move. Rules for people and coding agents are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
